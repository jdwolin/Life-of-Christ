For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40018008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.

I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40018033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40018034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40018035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.&#8221;</span></p></div>

What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p40019009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, &#8220;If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

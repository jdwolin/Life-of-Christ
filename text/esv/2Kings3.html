Will you go with me to battle against Moab?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;By which way shall we march?&#8221; Jehoram answered, &#8220;By the way of the wilderness of Edom.&#8221;</p><p id=p12003008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them. <b class=verse-num id=v12003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Israel said, &#8220;Alas! The LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?&#8221; Then one of the king of Israel&#8217;s servants answered, &#8220;Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;The word of the LORD is with him.&#8221; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</p><p id=p12003012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, &#8220;What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.&#8221; But the king of Israel said to him, &#8220;No; it is the LORD who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said, &#8220;As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I have regard for Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would neither look at you nor see you. <b class=verse-num id=v12003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But now bring me a musician.&#8221; And when the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon him. <b class=verse-num id=v12003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;I will make this dry streambed full of pools.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v12003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For thus says the LORD, &#8216;You shall not see wind or rain, but that streambed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your livestock, and your animals.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v12003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>This is a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also give the Moabites into your hand, <b class=verse-num id=v12003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree and stop up all springs of water and ruin every good piece of land with stones.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.</p><p id=p12003020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out and were drawn up at the border. <b class=verse-num id=v12003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And when they rose early in the morning and the sun shone on the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood. <b class=verse-num id=v12003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;This is blood; the kings have surely fought together and struck one another down. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and struck the Moabites, till they fled before them. And they went forward, striking the Moabites as they went. <b class=verse-num id=v12003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land every man threw a stone until it was covered. They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees, till only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded and attacked it. <b class=verse-num id=v12003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him 700 swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom, but they could not. <b class=verse-num id=v12003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel. And they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.</p></div>

But while they were eating of the stew, they cried out, &#8220;O man of God, there is death in the pot!&#8221; And they could not eat it. <b class=verse-num id=v12004041-1>41&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Then bring flour.&#8221; And he threw it into the pot and said, &#8220;Pour some out for the men, that they may eat.&#8221; And there was no harm in the pot.</p><p id=p12004041_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v12004042-1>42&nbsp;</b>A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Elisha said, &#8220;Give to the men, that they may eat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12004043-1>43&nbsp;</b>But his servant said, &#8220;How can I set this before a hundred men?&#8221; So he repeated, &#8220;Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, &#8216;They shall eat and have some left.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12004044-1>44&nbsp;</b>So he set it before them.

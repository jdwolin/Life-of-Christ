He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father&#8217;s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. <b class=verse-num id=v01037003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors. <b class=verse-num id=v01037004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.</p><p id=p01037004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. <b class=verse-num id=v01037006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Hear this dream that I have dreamed: <b class=verse-num id=v01037007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037008-1>8&nbsp;</b>His brothers said to him, &#8220;Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?&#8221; So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</p><p id=p01037008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, &#8220;Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, &#8220;What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</p><h3 id=p01037011_03-1>Joseph Sold by His Brothers</h3><p id=p01037011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now his brothers went to pasture their father&#8217;s flock near Shechem. <b class=verse-num id=v01037013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he said to him, &#8220;Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word.&#8221; So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <b class=verse-num id=v01037015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, &#8220;What are you seeking?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I am seeking my brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the man said, &#8220;They have gone away, for I heard them say, &#8216;Let us go to Dothan.&#8217;&#8221; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.</p><p id=p01037017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. <b class=verse-num id=v01037019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They said to one another, &#8220;Here comes this dreamer. <b class=verse-num id=v01037020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, &#8220;Let us not take his life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Reuben said to them, &#8220;Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him&#8221;&#8212;that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father. <b class=verse-num id=v01037023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore. <b class=verse-num id=v01037024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.</p><p id=p01037024_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01037026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to his brothers, &#8220;What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? <b class=verse-num id=v01037027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.&#8221; And his brothers listened to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01037028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.</p><p id=p01037028_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes <b class=verse-num id=v01037030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and returned to his brothers and said, &#8220;The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then they took Joseph&#8217;s robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. <b class=verse-num id=v01037032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, &#8220;This we have found; please identify whether it is your son&#8217;s robe or not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he identified it and said, &#8220;It is my son&#8217;s robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. <b class=verse-num id=v01037035-1>35&nbsp;</b>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, &#8220;No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.&#8221; Thus his father wept for him. <b class=verse-num id=v01037036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</p></div>

He took her and went in to her, <b class=verse-num id=v01038003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. <b class=verse-num id=v01038004-1>4&nbsp;</b>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. <b class=verse-num id=v01038005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah was in Chezib when she bore him.</p><p id=p01038005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <b class=verse-num id=v01038007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But Er, Judah&#8217;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death. <b class=verse-num id=v01038008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to Onan, &#8220;Go in to your brother&#8217;s wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother&#8217;s wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01038010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also. <b class=verse-num id=v01038011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, &#8220;Remain a widow in your father&#8217;s house, till Shelah my son grows up&#8221;&#8212;for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p01038011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038012-1>12&nbsp;</b>In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua&#8217;s daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. <b class=verse-num id=v01038013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when Tamar was told, &#8220;Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038014-1>14&nbsp;</b>she took off her widow&#8217;s garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage. <b class=verse-num id=v01038015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <b class=verse-num id=v01038016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He turned to her at the roadside and said, &#8220;Come, let me come in to you,&#8221; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, &#8220;What will you give me, that you may come in to me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;I will send you a young goat from the flock.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;If you give me a pledge, until you send it&#8212;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;What pledge shall I give you?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.&#8221; So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him. <b class=verse-num id=v01038019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.</p><p id=p01038019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman&#8217;s hand, he did not find her. <b class=verse-num id=v01038021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he asked the men of the place, &#8220;Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim at the roadside?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No cult prostitute has been here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So he returned to Judah and said, &#8220;I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, &#8216;No cult prostitute has been here.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Judah replied, &#8220;Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at.

Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.&#8221; And Judah said, &#8220;Bring her out, and let her be burned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038025-1>25&nbsp;</b>As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, &#8220;By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Judah identified them and said, &#8220;She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.&#8221; And he did not know her again.</p><p id=p01038026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb. <b class=verse-num id=v01038028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, &#8220;This one came out first.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, &#8220;What a breach you have made for yourself!&#8221; Therefore his name was called Perez. <b class=verse-num id=v01038030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.</p></div>

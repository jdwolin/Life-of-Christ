If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? <b class=verse-num id=v46012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. <b class=verse-num id=v46012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>If all were a single member, where would the body be? <b class=verse-num id=v46012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</p><p id=p46012020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The eye cannot say to the hand, &#8220;I have no need of you,&#8221; nor again the head to the feet, &#8220;I have no need of you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <b class=verse-num id=v46012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, <b class=verse-num id=v46012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, <b class=verse-num id=v46012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. <b class=verse-num id=v46012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</p><p id=p46012026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. <b class=verse-num id=v46012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. <b class=verse-num id=v46012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <b class=verse-num id=v46012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? <b class=verse-num id=v46012031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But earnestly desire the higher gifts.</p><p id=p46012031_08-1>And I will show you a still more excellent way.</p></div>

It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; <b class=verse-num id=v46013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v46013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p><p id=p46013007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. <b class=verse-num id=v46013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <b class=verse-num id=v46013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. <b class=verse-num id=v46013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. <b class=verse-num id=v46013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.</p><p id=p46013012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46014001_01-1>Prophecy and Tongues</h3><p id=p46014001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. <b class=verse-num id=v46014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v46014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. <b class=verse-num id=v46014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. <b class=verse-num id=v46014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.</p><p id=p46014005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? <b class=verse-num id=v46014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? <b class=verse-num id=v46014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? <b class=verse-num id=v46014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. <b class=verse-num id=v46014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, <b class=verse-num id=v46014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. <b class=verse-num id=v46014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</p><p id=p46014012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. <b class=verse-num id=v46014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. <b class=verse-num id=v46014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. <b class=verse-num id=v46014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? <b class=verse-num id=v46014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. <b class=verse-num id=v46014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <b class=verse-num id=v46014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p><p id=p46014019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. <b class=verse-num id=v46014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In the Law it is written, &#8220;By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. <b class=verse-num id=v46014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? <b class=verse-num id=v46014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, <b class=verse-num id=v46014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</p><h3 id=p46014025_04-1>Orderly Worship</h3><p id=p46014025_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. <b class=verse-num id=v46014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. <b class=verse-num id=v46014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. <b class=verse-num id=v46014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. <b class=verse-num id=v46014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. <b class=verse-num id=v46014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, <b class=verse-num id=v46014032-1>32&nbsp;</b>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v46014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</p><p id=p46014033_06-1>As in all the churches of the saints, <b class=verse-num id=v46014034-1>34&nbsp;</b>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. <b class=verse-num id=v46014035-1>35&nbsp;</b>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</p><p id=p46014035_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? <b class=verse-num id=v46014037-1>37&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46014038-1>38&nbsp;</b>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. <b class=verse-num id=v46014039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <b class=verse-num id=v46014040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But all things should be done decently and in order.</p></div>

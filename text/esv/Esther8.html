<p id=p17007001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. <b class=verse-num id=v17007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Queen Esther answered, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request. <b class=verse-num id=v17007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, &#8220;Who is he, and where is he, who has dared to do this?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Esther said, &#8220;A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!&#8221; Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.</p><h3 id=p17007006_01-1>Haman Is Hanged</h3><p id=p17007006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v17007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, &#8220;Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?&#8221; As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman&#8217;s face. <b class=verse-num id=v17007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, &#8220;Moreover, the gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman&#8217;s house, fifty cubits high.&#8221; And the king said, &#8220;Hang him on that.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king abated.</p></div>

And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her. <b class=verse-num id=v17008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p><p id=p17008002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, Esther rose and stood before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For how can I bear to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, &#8220;Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he intended to lay hands on the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king&#8217;s ring, for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king&#8217;s ring cannot be revoked.&#8221;</p><p id=p17008008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The king&#8217;s scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. And an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language. <b class=verse-num id=v17008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king&#8217;s signet ring. Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king&#8217;s service, bred from the royal stud, <b class=verse-num id=v17008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, children and women included, and to plunder their goods, <b class=verse-num id=v17008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. <b class=verse-num id=v17008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, being publicly displayed to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v17008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king&#8217;s service, rode out hurriedly, urged by the king&#8217;s command. And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.</p><p id=p17008014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a robe of fine linen and purple, and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. <b class=verse-num id=v17008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor. <b class=verse-num id=v17008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And in every province and in every city, wherever the king&#8217;s command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.</p></div>

<h3 id=p17009001_01-1>The Jews Destroy Their Enemies</h3><p id=p17009001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king&#8217;s command and edict were about to be carried out, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, the reverse occurred: the Jews gained mastery over those who hated them. <b class=verse-num id=v17009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen on all peoples. <b class=verse-num id=v17009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>All the officials of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal agents also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. <b class=verse-num id=v17009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For Mordecai was great in the king&#8217;s house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful. <b class=verse-num id=v17009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them. <b class=verse-num id=v17009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In Susa the citadel itself the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men, <b class=verse-num id=v17009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and also killed Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha <b class=verse-num id=v17009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha <b class=verse-num id=v17009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vaizatha, <b class=verse-num id=v17009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they laid no hand on the plunder.</p><p id=p17009010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v17009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>That very day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the king said to Queen Esther, &#8220;In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king&#8217;s provinces! Now what is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Esther said, &#8220;If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day&#8217;s edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the king commanded this to be done. A decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. <b class=verse-num id=v17009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed 300 men in Susa, but they laid no hands on the plunder.</p><p id=p17009015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v17009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king&#8217;s provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they laid no hands on the plunder. <b class=verse-num id=v17009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness. <b class=verse-num id=v17009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness. <b class=verse-num id=v17009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the rural towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another.</p><h3 id=p17009019_06-1>The Feast of Purim Inaugurated</h3><p id=p17009019_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v17009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, <b class=verse-num id=v17009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year, <b class=verse-num id=v17009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and gifts to the poor.</p><p id=p17009022_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v17009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So the Jews accepted what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them. <b class=verse-num id=v17009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is, cast lots), to crush and to destroy them. <b class=verse-num id=v17009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But when it came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his evil plan that he had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. <b class=verse-num id=v17009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. Therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had happened to them, <b class=verse-num id=v17009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>the Jews firmly obligated themselves and their offspring and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year, <b class=verse-num id=v17009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every clan, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.</p><p id=p17009028_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v17009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim. <b class=verse-num id=v17009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, in words of peace and truth, <b class=verse-num id=v17009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther obligated them, and as they had obligated themselves and their offspring, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting. <b class=verse-num id=v17009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The command of Esther confirmed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.</p></div>

Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.&#8221;</p><p id=p26010002_09-1>And he went in before my eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v26010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. <b class=verse-num id=v26010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</p><p id=p26010005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, &#8220;Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,&#8221; he went in and stood beside a wheel. <b class=verse-num id=v26010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out. <b class=verse-num id=v26010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.</p><p id=p26010008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling beryl. <b class=verse-num id=v26010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel. <b class=verse-num id=v26010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without turning as they went. <b class=verse-num id=v26010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around&#8212;the wheels that the four of them had. <b class=verse-num id=v26010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing &#8220;the whirling wheels.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p><p id=p26010014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the cherubim mounted up.

And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v26011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city; <b class=verse-num id=v26011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>who say, &#8216;The time is not near to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man.&#8221;</p><p id=p26011004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, &#8220;Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel.

I will judge you at the border of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v26011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you.&#8221;</p><p id=p26011012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died.

<h3 id=p07007001_01-1>Gideon&#8217;s Three Hundred Men</h3><p id=p07007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p><p id=p07007001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, &#8216;My own hand has saved me.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, &#8216;Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.&#8217;&#8221; Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.</p><p id=p07007003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, &#8216;This one shall go with you,&#8217; shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, &#8216;This one shall not go with you,&#8217; shall not go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. <b class=verse-num id=v07007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</p><p id=p07007008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>That same night the LORD said to him, &#8220;Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v07007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v07007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.&#8221; Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v07007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance. <b class=verse-num id=v07007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, &#8220;Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And his comrade answered, &#8220;This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp.&#8221;</p><p id=p07007014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, &#8220;Arise, for the LORD has given the host of Midian into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars. <b class=verse-num id=v07007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. <b class=verse-num id=v07007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, &#8216;For the LORD and for Gideon.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3 id=p07007018_05-1>Gideon Defeats Midian</h3><p id=p07007018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v07007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, &#8220;A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled. <b class=verse-num id=v07007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When they blew the 300 trumpets, the LORD set every man&#8217;s sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v07007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.</p><p id=p07007023_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, &#8220;Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.&#8221; So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v07007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.</p></div>

Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer? <b class=verse-num id=v07008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?&#8221; Then their anger against him subsided when he said this.</p><p id=p07008003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing. <b class=verse-num id=v07008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So he said to the men of Succoth, &#8220;Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the officials of Succoth said, &#8220;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Gideon said, &#8220;Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. <b class=verse-num id=v07008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to the men of Penuel, &#8220;When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.&#8221;</p><p id=p07008009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men who drew the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v07008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt secure. <b class=verse-num id=v07008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.</p><p id=p07008012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. <b class=verse-num id=v07008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men. <b class=verse-num id=v07008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he came to the men of Succoth and said, &#8220;Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, &#8216;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson. <b class=verse-num id=v07008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.</p><p id=p07008017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, &#8220;Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So he said to Jether his firstborn, &#8220;Rise and kill them!&#8221; But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man. <b class=verse-num id=v07008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, &#8220;Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength.&#8221; And Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.</p><h3 id=p07008021_06-1>Gideon&#8217;s Ephod</h3><p id=p07008021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, &#8220;Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Gideon said to them, &#8220;I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Gideon said to them, &#8220;Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil.&#8221; (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) <b class=verse-num id=v07008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they answered, &#8220;We will willingly give them.&#8221; And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil. <b class=verse-num id=v07008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels. <b class=verse-num id=v07008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family. <b class=verse-num id=v07008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more.

And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as your hand finds to do.&#8221;</p><p id=p07009033_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies. <b class=verse-num id=v07009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush. <b class=verse-num id=v07009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, &#8220;Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!&#8221; And Zebul said to him, &#8220;You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Gaal spoke again and said, &#8220;Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners&#8217; Oak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Zebul said to him, &#8220;Where is your mouth now, you who said, &#8216;Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?&#8217; Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. <b class=verse-num id=v07009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v07009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem.</p><p id=p07009041_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009042-1>42&nbsp;</b>On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told. <b class=verse-num id=v07009043-1>43&nbsp;</b>He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them. <b class=verse-num id=v07009044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them. <b class=verse-num id=v07009045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.</p><p id=p07009045_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009046-1>46&nbsp;</b>When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith. <b class=verse-num id=v07009047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together. <b class=verse-num id=v07009048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, &#8220;What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009049-1>49&nbsp;</b>So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.</p><p id=p07009049_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it. <b class=verse-num id=v07009051-1>51&nbsp;</b>But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower. <b class=verse-num id=v07009052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v07009053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech&#8217;s head and crushed his skull. <b class=verse-num id=v07009054-1>54&nbsp;</b>Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, &#8220;Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, &#8216;A woman killed him.&#8217;&#8221; And his young man thrust him through, and he died. <b class=verse-num id=v07009055-1>55&nbsp;</b>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone departed to his home. <b class=verse-num id=v07009056-1>56&nbsp;</b>Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v07009057-1>57&nbsp;</b>And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</p></div>

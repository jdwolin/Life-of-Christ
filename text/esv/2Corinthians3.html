<p id=p47002001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. <b class=verse-num id=v47002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? <b class=verse-num id=v47002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. <b class=verse-num id=v47002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</p><h3 id=p47002004_01-1>Forgive the Sinner</h3><p id=p47002004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v47002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure&#8212;not to put it too severely&#8212;to all of you. <b class=verse-num id=v47002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, <b class=verse-num id=v47002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. <b class=verse-num id=v47002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. <b class=verse-num id=v47002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. <b class=verse-num id=v47002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v47002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</p><h3 id=p47002011_04-1>Triumph in Christ</h3><p id=p47002011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v47002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, <b class=verse-num id=v47002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</p><p id=p47002013_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v47002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. <b class=verse-num id=v47002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, <b class=verse-num id=v47002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? <b class=verse-num id=v47002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God&#8217;s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</p></div>

<h3 id=p47003001_01-1>Ministers of the New Covenant</h3><p id=p47003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? <b class=verse-num id=v47003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. <b class=verse-num id=v47003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</p><p id=p47003003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. <b class=verse-num id=v47003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, <b class=verse-num id=v47003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</p><p id=p47003006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses&#8217; face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, <b class=verse-num id=v47003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? <b class=verse-num id=v47003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. <b class=verse-num id=v47003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. <b class=verse-num id=v47003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.</p><p id=p47003011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, <b class=verse-num id=v47003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. <b class=verse-num id=v47003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. <b class=verse-num id=v47003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. <b class=verse-num id=v47003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. <b class=verse-num id=v47003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. <b class=verse-num id=v47003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.</p></div>

<h3 id=p47004001_01-1>The Light of the Gospel</h3><p id=p47004001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. <b class=verse-num id=v47004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God&#8217;s word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone&#8217;s conscience in the sight of God. <b class=verse-num id=v47004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. <b class=verse-num id=v47004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. <b class=verse-num id=v47004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&#8217; sake. <b class=verse-num id=v47004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For God, who said, &#8220;Let light shine out of darkness,&#8221; has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p><h3 id=p47004006_06-1>Treasure in Jars of Clay</h3><p id=p47004006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. <b class=verse-num id=v47004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; <b class=verse-num id=v47004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; <b class=verse-num id=v47004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. <b class=verse-num id=v47004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus&#8217; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v47004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So death is at work in us, but life in you.</p><p id=p47004012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, &#8220;I believed, and so I spoke,&#8221; we also believe, and so we also speak, <b class=verse-num id=v47004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. <b class=verse-num id=v47004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p><p id=p47004015_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. <b class=verse-num id=v47004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, <b class=verse-num id=v47004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</p></div>

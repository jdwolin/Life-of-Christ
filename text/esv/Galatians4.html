<h3 id=p48003001_01-1>By Faith, or by Works of the Law?</h3><p id=p48003001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. <b class=verse-num id=v48003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? <b class=verse-num id=v48003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? <b class=verse-num id=v48003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Did you suffer so many things in vain&#8212;if indeed it was in vain? <b class=verse-num id=v48003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>just as Abraham &#8220;believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness&#8221;?</p><p id=p48003006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v48003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &#8220;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</p><h3 id=p48003009_09-1>The Righteous Shall Live by Faith</h3><p id=p48003009_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, &#8220;Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for &#8220;The righteous shall live by faith.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the law is not of faith, rather &#8220;The one who does them shall live by them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us&#8212;for it is written, &#8220;Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</p><h3 id=p48003014_15-1>The Law and the Promise</h3><p id=p48003014_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. <b class=verse-num id=v48003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, &#8220;And to offsprings,&#8221; referring to many, but referring to one, &#8220;And to your offspring,&#8221; who is Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. <b class=verse-num id=v48003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</p><p id=p48003018_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. <b class=verse-num id=v48003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.</p><p id=p48003020_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. <b class=verse-num id=v48003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p><p id=p48003022_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. <b class=verse-num id=v48003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. <b class=verse-num id=v48003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, <b class=verse-num id=v48003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. <b class=verse-num id=v48003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v48003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And if you are Christ&#8217;s, then you are Abraham&#8217;s offspring, heirs according to promise.</p></div>

<h3 id=p48004001_01-1>Sons and Heirs</h3><p id=p48004001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, <b class=verse-num id=v48004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. <b class=verse-num id=v48004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. <b class=verse-num id=v48004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, <b class=verse-num id=v48004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. <b class=verse-num id=v48004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &#8220;Abba! Father!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.</p><h3 id=p48004007_04-1>Paul&#8217;s Concern for the Galatians</h3><p id=p48004007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v48004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? <b class=verse-num id=v48004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You observe days and months and seasons and years! <b class=verse-num id=v48004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.</p><p id=p48004011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong. <b class=verse-num id=v48004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first, <b class=verse-num id=v48004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v48004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me. <b class=verse-num id=v48004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? <b class=verse-num id=v48004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. <b class=verse-num id=v48004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, <b class=verse-num id=v48004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you! <b class=verse-num id=v48004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</p><h3 id=p48004020_09-1>Example of Hagar and Sarah</h3><p id=p48004020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? <b class=verse-num id=v48004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. <b class=verse-num id=v48004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. <b class=verse-num id=v48004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. <b class=verse-num id=v48004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. <b class=verse-num id=v48004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. <b class=verse-num id=v48004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear;</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor!</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the children of the desolate one will be more</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than those of the one who has a husband.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p48004027_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v48004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <b class=verse-num id=v48004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. <b class=verse-num id=v48004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But what does the Scripture say? &#8220;Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.</p></div>

Who hindered you from obeying the truth? <b class=verse-num id=v48005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>This persuasion is not from him who calls you. <b class=verse-num id=v48005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. <b class=verse-num id=v48005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. <b class=verse-num id=v48005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. <b class=verse-num id=v48005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!</p><p id=p48005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. <b class=verse-num id=v48005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</p><h3 id=p48005015_06-1>Keep in Step with the Spirit</h3><p id=p48005015_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v48005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. <b class=verse-num id=v48005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, <b class=verse-num id=v48005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, <b class=verse-num id=v48005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v48005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <b class=verse-num id=v48005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</p><p id=p48005024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v48005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</p></div>

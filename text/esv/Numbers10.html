<h3 id=p04009001_01-1>The Passover Celebrated</h3><p id=p04009001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v04009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time. <b class=verse-num id=v04009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover. <b class=verse-num id=v04009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did. <b class=verse-num id=v04009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And there were certain men who were unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. <b class=verse-num id=v04009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And those men said to him, &#8220;We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the LORD&#8217;s offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to them, &#8220;Wait, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.&#8221;</p><p id=p04009008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v04009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. <b class=verse-num id=v04009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any of its bones; according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it. <b class=verse-num id=v04009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD&#8217;s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin. <b class=verse-num id=v04009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p04009014_04-1>The Cloud Covering the Tabernacle</h3><p id=p04009014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning. <b class=verse-num id=v04009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So it was always: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night. <b class=verse-num id=v04009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped. <b class=verse-num id=v04009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.</p></div>

An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not sound an alarm. <b class=verse-num id=v04010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations. <b class=verse-num id=v04010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v04010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

And the people of Israel also wept again and said, &#8220;Oh that we had meat to eat! <b class=verse-num id=v04011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. <b class=verse-num id=v04011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.&#8221;</p><p id=p04011006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium. <b class=verse-num id=v04011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil. <b class=verse-num id=v04011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.</p><p id=p04011009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased. <b class=verse-num id=v04011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Moses said to the LORD, &#8220;Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? <b class=verse-num id=v04011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, &#8216;Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,&#8217; to the land that you swore to give their fathers? <b class=verse-num id=v04011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, &#8216;Give us meat, that we may eat.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v04011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me. <b class=verse-num id=v04011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p04011015_04-1>Elders Appointed to Aid Moses</h3><p id=p04011015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you. <b class=verse-num id=v04011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone. <b class=verse-num id=v04011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And say to the people, &#8216;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, &#8220;Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt.&#8221; Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat. <b class=verse-num id=v04011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, <b class=verse-num id=v04011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, &#8220;Why did we come out of Egypt?&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Moses said, &#8220;The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, &#8216;I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v04011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them?

And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent. <b class=verse-num id=v04011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.</p><p id=p04011025_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And a young man ran and told Moses, &#8220;Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, &#8220;My lord Moses, stop them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But Moses said to him, &#8220;Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets, that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</p><h3 id=p04011030_09-1>Quail and a Plague</h3><p id=p04011030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day&#8217;s journey on this side and a day&#8217;s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v04011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague. <b class=verse-num id=v04011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving. <b class=verse-num id=v04011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.</p></div>

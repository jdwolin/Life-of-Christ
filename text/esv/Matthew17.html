Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p><h3 id=p40016012_14-1>Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</h3><p id=p40016012_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v40016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Who do people say that the Son of Man is?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter replied, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</p><h3 id=p40016020_20-1>Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3><p id=p40016020_26-1><b class=verse-num id=v40016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. <b class=verse-num id=v40016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, &#8220;Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But he turned and said to Peter, <span class=woc>&#8220;Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40016023_26-1>Take Up Your Cross and Follow Jesus</h3><p id=p40016023_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v40016024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus told his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40016028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.&#8221;</span></p></div>

<h3 id=p40017001_01-1>The Transfiguration</h3><p id=p40017001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v40017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v40017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. <b class=verse-num id=v40017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. <b class=verse-num id=v40017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. <b class=verse-num id=v40017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise, and have no fear.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p><p id=p40017008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the disciples asked him, &#8220;Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p><h3 id=p40017013_03-1>Jesus Heals a Boy with a Demon</h3><p id=p40017013_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him, <b class=verse-num id=v40017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>said, &#8220;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. <b class=verse-num id=v40017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly. <b class=verse-num id=v40017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &#8216;Move from here to there,&#8217; and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40017020_10-1>Jesus Again Foretells Death, Resurrection</h3><p id=p40017020_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.&#8221;</span> And they were greatly distressed.</p><h3 id=p40017023_15-1>The Temple Tax</h3><p id=p40017023_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went up to Peter and said, &#8220;Does your teacher not pay the tax?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he said, &#8220;From others,&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Then the sons are free.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.&#8221;</span></p></div>

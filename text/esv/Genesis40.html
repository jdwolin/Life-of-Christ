How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01039010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.</p><p id=p01039010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01039011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, <b class=verse-num id=v01039012-1>12&nbsp;</b>she caught him by his garment, saying, &#8220;Lie with me.&#8221; But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house. <b class=verse-num id=v01039013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house, <b class=verse-num id=v01039014-1>14&nbsp;</b>she called to the men of her household and said to them, &#8220;See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. <b class=verse-num id=v01039015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01039016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home, <b class=verse-num id=v01039017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and she told him the same story, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me. <b class=verse-num id=v01039018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.&#8221;</p><p id=p01039018_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01039019-1>19&nbsp;</b>As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, &#8220;This is the way your servant treated me,&#8221; his anger was kindled. <b class=verse-num id=v01039020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Joseph&#8217;s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king&#8217;s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison. <b class=verse-num id=v01039021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. <b class=verse-num id=v01039022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it. <b class=verse-num id=v01039023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph&#8217;s charge, because the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.</p></div>

They continued for some time in custody.</p><p id=p01040004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And one night they both dreamed&#8212;the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison&#8212;each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v01040006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled. <b class=verse-num id=v01040007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So he asked Pharaoh&#8217;s officers who were with him in custody in his master&#8217;s house, &#8220;Why are your faces downcast today?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01040008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.&#8221; And Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01040008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, &#8220;In my dream there was a vine before me, <b class=verse-num id=v01040010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. <b class=verse-num id=v01040011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Pharaoh&#8217;s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01040012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to him, &#8220;This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <b class=verse-num id=v01040013-1>13&nbsp;</b>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer. <b class=verse-num id=v01040014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. <b class=verse-num id=v01040015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.&#8221;</p><p id=p01040015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, &#8220;I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head, <b class=verse-num id=v01040017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01040018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Joseph answered and said, &#8220;This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days. <b class=verse-num id=v01040019-1>19&nbsp;</b>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head&#8212;from you!&#8212;and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.&#8221;</p><p id=p01040019_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040020-1>20&nbsp;</b>On the third day, which was Pharaoh&#8217;s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v01040021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand. <b class=verse-num id=v01040022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. <b class=verse-num id=v01040023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</p></div>

And Pharaoh awoke. <b class=verse-num id=v01041005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. <b class=verse-num id=v01041006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. <b class=verse-num id=v01041007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. <b class=verse-num id=v01041008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</p><p id=p01041008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, &#8220;I remember my offenses today. <b class=verse-num id=v01041010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, <b class=verse-num id=v01041011-1>11&nbsp;</b>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v01041012-1>12&nbsp;</b>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. <b class=verse-num id=v01041013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v01041015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Joseph answered Pharaoh, &#8220;It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile. <b class=verse-num id=v01041018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. <b class=verse-num id=v01041019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows, <b class=verse-num id=v01041021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke. <b class=verse-num id=v01041022-1>22&nbsp;</b>I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good. <b class=verse-num id=v01041023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, <b class=verse-num id=v01041024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &#8220;The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <b class=verse-num id=v01041026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. <b class=verse-num id=v01041027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. <b class=verse-num id=v01041028-1>28&nbsp;</b>It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <b class=verse-num id=v01041029-1>29&nbsp;</b>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v01041030-1>30&nbsp;</b>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, <b class=verse-num id=v01041031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. <b class=verse-num id=v01041032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the doubling of Pharaoh&#8217;s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about. <b class=verse-num id=v01041033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. <b class=verse-num id=v01041035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. <b class=verse-num id=v01041036-1>36&nbsp;</b>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01041036_05-1>Joseph Rises to Power</h3><p id=p01041036_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041037-1>37&nbsp;</b>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v01041038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to his servants, &#8220;Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. <b class=verse-num id=v01041040-1>40&nbsp;</b>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph&#8217;s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. <b class=verse-num id=v01041043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, &#8220;Bow the knee!&#8221; Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh called Joseph&#8217;s name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p><p id=p01041045_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041047-1>47&nbsp;</b>During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly, <b class=verse-num id=v01041048-1>48&nbsp;</b>and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it. <b class=verse-num id=v01041049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</p><p id=p01041049_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01041051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. &#8220;For,&#8221; he said, &#8220;God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The name of the second he called Ephraim, &#8220;For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041052_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041053-1>53&nbsp;</b>The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end, <b class=verse-num id=v01041054-1>54&nbsp;</b>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <b class=verse-num id=v01041055-1>55&nbsp;</b>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &#8220;Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041055_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041056-1>56&nbsp;</b>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041057-1>57&nbsp;</b>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01042001_01-1>Joseph&#8217;s Brothers Go to Egypt</h3><p id=p01042001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01042001-1>42:1&nbsp;</b>When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, &#8220;Why do you look at one another?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So ten of Joseph&#8217;s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01042004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph&#8217;s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01042005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p><p id=p01042005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph&#8217;s brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01042007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; he said. They said, &#8220;From the land of Canaan, to buy food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. <b class=verse-num id=v01042009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, &#8220;You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. <b class=verse-num id=v01042011-1>11&nbsp;</b>We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.&#8221;</p><p id=p01042011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But Joseph said to them, &#8220;It is as I said to you. You are spies. <b class=verse-num id=v01042015-1>15&nbsp;</b>By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. <b class=verse-num id=v01042016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he put them all together in custody for three days.</p><p id=p01042017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042018-1>18&nbsp;</b>On the third day Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do this and you will live, for I fear God: <b class=verse-num id=v01042019-1>19&nbsp;</b>if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, <b class=verse-num id=v01042020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.&#8221; And they did so. <b class=verse-num id=v01042021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they said to one another, &#8220;In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Reuben answered them, &#8220;Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042023-1>23&nbsp;</b>They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. <b class=verse-num id=v01042024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v01042025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man&#8217;s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.</p><p id=p01042025_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed. <b class=verse-num id=v01042027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack. <b class=verse-num id=v01042028-1>28&nbsp;</b>He said to his brothers, &#8220;My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!&#8221; At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, &#8220;What is this that God has done to us?&#8221;</p><p id=p01042028_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v01042030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01042031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But we said to him, &#8216;We are honest men; we have never been spies. <b class=verse-num id=v01042032-1>32&nbsp;</b>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01042033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, &#8216;By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. <b class=verse-num id=v01042034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01042034_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042035-1>35&nbsp;</b>As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man&#8217;s bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v01042036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And Jacob their father said to them, &#8220;You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then Reuben said to his father, &#8220;Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042038-1>38&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p01043001_01-1>Joseph&#8217;s Brothers Return to Egypt</h3><p id=p01043001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01043001-1>43:1&nbsp;</b>Now the famine was severe in the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01043002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, &#8220;Go again, buy us a little food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Judah said to him, &#8220;The man solemnly warned us, saying, &#8216;You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01043004-1>4&nbsp;</b>If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. <b class=verse-num id=v01043005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, &#8216;You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Israel said, &#8220;Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They replied, &#8220;The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, &#8216;Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?&#8217; What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, &#8216;Bring your brother down&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Judah said to Israel his father, &#8220;Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones. <b class=verse-num id=v01043009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever. <b class=verse-num id=v01043010-1>10&nbsp;</b>If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.&#8221;</p><p id=p01043010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01043011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then their father Israel said to them, &#8220;If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. <b class=verse-num id=v01043012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. <b class=verse-num id=v01043013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man. <b class=verse-num id=v01043014-1>14&nbsp;</b>May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.&#8221;</p><p id=p01043014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01043015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.</p><p id=p01043015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01043016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, &#8220;Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01043018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph&#8217;s house, and they said, &#8220;It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So they went up to the steward of Joseph&#8217;s house and spoke with him at the door of the house, <b class=verse-num id=v01043020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food. <b class=verse-num id=v01043021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man&#8217;s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us, <b class=verse-num id=v01043022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He replied, &#8220;Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money.&#8221; Then he brought Simeon out to them. <b class=verse-num id=v01043024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when the man had brought the men into Joseph&#8217;s house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder, <b class=verse-num id=v01043025-1>25&nbsp;</b>they prepared the present for Joseph&#8217;s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p><p id=p01043025_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01043026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01043027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he inquired about their welfare and said, &#8220;Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043028-1>28&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.&#8221; And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v01043029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&#8217;s son, and said, &#8220;Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. <b class=verse-num id=v01043031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, &#8220;Serve the food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v01043033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement. <b class=verse-num id=v01043034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Portions were taken to them from Joseph&#8217;s table, but Benjamin&#8217;s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01044001_01-1>Joseph Tests His Brothers</h3><p id=p01044001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01044001-1>44:1&nbsp;</b>Then he commanded the steward of his house, &#8220;Fill the men&#8217;s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man&#8217;s money in the mouth of his sack, <b class=verse-num id=v01044002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.&#8221; And he did as Joseph told him.</p><p id=p01044002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044003-1>3&nbsp;</b>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v01044004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, &#8220;Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, &#8216;Why have you repaid evil for good? <b class=verse-num id=v01044005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01044005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. <b class=verse-num id=v01044007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! <b class=verse-num id=v01044008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord&#8217;s house? <b class=verse-num id=v01044009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord&#8217;s servants.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. <b class=verse-num id=v01044012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin&#8217;s sack. <b class=verse-num id=v01044013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.</p><p id=p01044013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph&#8217;s house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01044015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Joseph said to them, &#8220;What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Judah said, &#8220;What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord&#8217;s servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.&#8221;</p><p id=p01044017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Judah went up to him and said, &#8220;Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord&#8217;s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself. <b class=verse-num id=v01044019-1>19&nbsp;</b>My lord asked his servants, saying, &#8216;Have you a father, or a brother?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And we said to my lord, &#8216;We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age.

If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man&#8217;s face unless our youngest brother is with us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then your servant my father said to us, &#8216;You know that my wife bore me two sons. <b class=verse-num id=v01044028-1>28&nbsp;</b>One left me, and I said, &#8220;Surely he has been torn to pieces,&#8221; and I have never seen him since. <b class=verse-num id=v01044029-1>29&nbsp;</b>If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.&#8217;</p><p id=p01044029_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy&#8217;s life, <b class=verse-num id=v01044031-1>31&nbsp;</b>as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. <b class=verse-num id=v01044032-1>32&nbsp;</b>For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, &#8216;If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v01044034-1>34&nbsp;</b>For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.&#8221;</p></div>

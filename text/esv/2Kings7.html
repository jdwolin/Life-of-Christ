<h3 id=p12006001_01-1>The Axe Head Recovered</h3><p id=p12006001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, &#8220;See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us. <b class=verse-num id=v12006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then one of them said, &#8220;Be pleased to go with your servants.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. <b class=verse-num id=v12006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, &#8220;Alas, my master! It was borrowed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the man of God said, &#8220;Where did it fall?&#8221; When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float. <b class=verse-num id=v12006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Take it up.&#8221; So he reached out his hand and took it.</p><h3 id=p12006007_05-1>Horses and Chariots of Fire</h3><p id=p12006007_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, &#8220;At such and such a place shall be my camp.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, &#8220;Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.</p><p id=p12006010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, &#8220;Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And one of his servants said, &#8220;None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.&#8221; It was told him, &#8220;Behold, he is in Dothan.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.</p><p id=p12006014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, &#8220;Alas, my master! What shall we do?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Elisha prayed and said, &#8220;O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.&#8221; So the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. <b class=verse-num id=v12006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, &#8220;Please strike this people with blindness.&#8221; So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha. <b class=verse-num id=v12006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to them, &#8220;This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.&#8221; And he led them to Samaria.</p><p id=p12006019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, &#8220;O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.&#8221; So the LORD opened their eyes and they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v12006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>As soon as the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, &#8220;My father, shall I strike them down? Shall I strike them down?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;You shall not strike them down. Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So he prepared for them a great feast, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians did not come again on raids into the land of Israel.</p><h3 id=p12006023_10-1>Ben-hadad&#8217;s Siege of Samaria</h3><p id=p12006023_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v12006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Afterward Ben-hadad king of Syria mustered his entire army and went up and besieged Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v12006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And there was a great famine in Samaria, as they besieged it, until a donkey&#8217;s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove&#8217;s dung for five shekels of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v12006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, &#8220;Help, my lord, O king!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;If the LORD will not help you, how shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the winepress?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And the king asked her, &#8220;What is your trouble?&#8221; She answered, &#8220;This woman said to me, &#8216;Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v12006029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, &#8216;Give your son, that we may eat him.&#8217; But she has hidden her son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes&#8212;now he was passing by on the wall&#8212;and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v12006031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and he said, &#8220;May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today.&#8221;</p><p id=p12006031_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v12006032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence, but before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, &#8220;Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master&#8217;s feet behind him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12006033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And while he was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him and said, &#8220;This trouble is from the LORD! Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?&#8221;</p></div>

And they said to one another, &#8220;Why are we sitting here until we die? <b class=verse-num id=v12007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>If we say, &#8216;Let us enter the city,&#8217; the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there. <b class=verse-num id=v12007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, &#8220;Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives. <b class=verse-num id=v12007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and went and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent and carried off things from it and went and hid them.</p><p id=p12007008_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v12007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then they said to one another, &#8220;We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come; let us go and tell the king&#8217;s household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, &#8220;We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king&#8217;s household. <b class=verse-num id=v12007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the king rose in the night and said to his servants, &#8220;I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, &#8216;When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And one of his servants said, &#8220;Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel who have already perished. Let us send and see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So they took two horsemen, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, &#8220;Go and see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So they went after them as far as the Jordan, and behold, all the way was littered with garments and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.</p><p id=p12007015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v12007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians.

And the people trampled him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him. <b class=verse-num id=v12007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For when the man of God had said to the king, &#8220;Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>the captain had answered the man of God, &#8220;If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?&#8221; And he had said, &#8220;You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate and he died.</p></div>

She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. <b class=verse-num id=v12008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land. <b class=verse-num id=v12008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, &#8220;Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And while he was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, &#8220;My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, &#8220;Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p12008006_05-1>Hazael Murders Ben-hadad</h3><p id=p12008006_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Elisha came to Damascus. Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And when it was told him, &#8220;The man of God has come here,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>the king said to Hazael, &#8220;Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this sickness?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camels&#8217; loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, &#8220;Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this sickness?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Go, say to him, &#8216;You shall certainly recover,&#8217; but the LORD has shown me that he shall certainly die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was embarrassed. And the man of God wept. <b class=verse-num id=v12008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Hazael said, &#8220;Why does my lord weep?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Hazael said, &#8220;What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?&#8221; Elisha answered, &#8220;The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, &#8220;What did Elisha say to you?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;He told me that you would certainly recover.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the next day he took the bed cloth and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died.

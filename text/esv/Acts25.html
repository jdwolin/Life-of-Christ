<h3 id=p44024001_01-1>Paul Before Felix at Caesarea</h3><p id=p44024001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:</p><p id=p44024002_06-1>&#8220;Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation, <b class=verse-num id=v44024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. <b class=verse-num id=v44024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. <b class=verse-num id=v44024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. <b class=verse-num id=v44024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. <b class=verse-num id=v44024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44024008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.</p><p id=p44024009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:</p><p id=p44024010_06-1>&#8220;Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. <b class=verse-num id=v44024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v44024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city. <b class=verse-num id=v44024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. <b class=verse-num id=v44024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, <b class=verse-num id=v44024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. <b class=verse-num id=v44024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man. <b class=verse-num id=v44024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v44024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v44024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me. <b class=verse-num id=v44024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, <b class=verse-num id=v44024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: &#8216;It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44024021_06-1>Paul Kept in Custody</h3><p id=p44024021_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, &#8220;When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.</p><p id=p44024023_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024024-1>24&nbsp;</b>After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, &#8220;Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44024026-1>26&nbsp;</b>At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44025001_01-1>Paul Appeals to Caesar</h3><p id=p44025001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44025001-1>25:1&nbsp;</b>Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. <b class=verse-num id=v44025002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him, <b class=verse-num id=v44025003-1>3&nbsp;</b>asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem&#8212;because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way. <b class=verse-num id=v44025004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly. <b class=verse-num id=v44025005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44025005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44025006-1>6&nbsp;</b>After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. <b class=verse-num id=v44025007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove. <b class=verse-num id=v44025008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Paul argued in his defense, &#8220;Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, &#8220;Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Paul said, &#8220;I am standing before Caesar&#8217;s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well. <b class=verse-num id=v44025011-1>11&nbsp;</b>If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, &#8220;To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44025012_05-1>Paul Before Agrippa and Bernice</h3><p id=p44025012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44025013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. <b class=verse-num id=v44025014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul&#8217;s case before the king, saying, &#8220;There is a man left prisoner by Felix, <b class=verse-num id=v44025015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. <b class=verse-num id=v44025016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. <b class=verse-num id=v44025017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought. <b class=verse-num id=v44025018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed. <b class=verse-num id=v44025019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44025020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. <b class=verse-num id=v44025021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Agrippa said to Festus, &#8220;I would like to hear the man myself.&#8221; &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you will hear him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44025022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44025023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. <b class=verse-num id=v44025024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Festus said, &#8220;King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. <b class=verse-num id=v44025025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him. <b class=verse-num id=v44025026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. <b class=verse-num id=v44025027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.&#8221;</p></div>

Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.</p><p id=p44026003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. <b class=verse-num id=v44026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v44026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! <b class=verse-num id=v44026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</p><p id=p44026008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <b class=verse-num id=v44026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. <b class=verse-num id=v44026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</p><h3 id=p44026011_05-1>Paul Tells of His Conversion</h3><p id=p44026011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. <b class=verse-num id=v44026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me. <b class=verse-num id=v44026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, <span class=woc>&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8216;Who are you, Lord?&#8217; And the Lord said, <span class=woc>&#8216;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44026016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44026017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles&#8212;to whom I am sending you</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44026018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.&#8217;</span></p><p id=p44026018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <b class=verse-num id=v44026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. <b class=verse-num id=v44026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. <b class=verse-num id=v44026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: <b class=verse-num id=v44026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.&#8221;</p><p id=p44026023_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, &#8220;Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But Paul said, &#8220;I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. <b class=verse-num id=v44026026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner. <b class=verse-num id=v44026027-1>27&nbsp;</b>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Agrippa said to Paul, &#8220;In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am&#8212;except for these chains.&#8221;</p><p id=p44026029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. <b class=verse-num id=v44026031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, &#8220;This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Agrippa said to Festus, &#8220;This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09016001_01-1>David Anointed King</h3><p id=p09016001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09016001-1>16:1&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said, &#8220;How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.&#8221; And the LORD said, &#8220;Take a heifer with you and say, &#8216;I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said, &#8220;Do you come peaceably?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&#8221; And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</p><p id=p09016005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, &#8220;Surely the LORD&#8217;s anointed is before him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;The LORD has not chosen these.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Are all your sons here?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.&#8221; And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, &#8220;Arise, anoint him, for this is he.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</p><h3 id=p09016013_04-1>David in Saul&#8217;s Service</h3><p id=p09016013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him. <b class=verse-num id=v09016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Saul&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you. <b class=verse-num id=v09016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Let our lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Saul said to his servants, &#8220;Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>One of the young men answered, &#8220;Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, and the LORD is with him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, &#8220;Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v09016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer. <b class=verse-num id=v09016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &#8220;Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.</p></div>

And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. <b class=verse-num id=v09017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them. <b class=verse-num id=v09017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. <b class=verse-num id=v09017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v09017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. <b class=verse-num id=v09017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The shaft of his spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam, and his spear&#8217;s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, &#8220;Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. <b class=verse-num id=v09017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said, &#8220;I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</p><p id=p09017011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years. <b class=verse-num id=v09017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. <b class=verse-num id=v09017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul, <b class=verse-num id=v09017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father&#8217;s sheep at Bethlehem. <b class=verse-num id=v09017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.</p><p id=p09017016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesse said to David his son, &#8220;Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v09017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring some token from them.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry. <b class=verse-num id=v09017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. <b class=verse-num id=v09017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v09017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.</p><p id=p09017023_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v09017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel said, &#8220;Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father&#8217;s house free in Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And David said to the men who stood by him, &#8220;What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And the people answered him in the same way, &#8220;So shall it be done to the man who kills him.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017027_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab&#8217;s anger was kindled against David, and he said, &#8220;Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;What have I done now? Was it not but a word?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.</p><p id=p09017030_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Let no man&#8217;s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to David, &#8220;You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But David said to Saul, &#8220;Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, <b class=verse-num id=v09017035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221; And Saul said to David, &#8220;Go, and the LORD be with you!&#8221;</p><p id=p09017037_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail, <b class=verse-num id=v09017039-1>39&nbsp;</b>and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, &#8220;I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.&#8221; So David put them off. <b class=verse-num id=v09017040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd&#8217;s pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.</p><p id=p09017040_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v09017043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said to David, &#8220;Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?&#8221; And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <b class=verse-num id=v09017044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The Philistine said to David, &#8220;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the Philistine, &#8220;You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <b class=verse-num id=v09017046-1>46&nbsp;</b>This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v09017047-1>47&nbsp;</b>and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD&#8217;s, and he will give you into our hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017047_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017048-1>48&nbsp;</b>When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. <b class=verse-num id=v09017049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p><p id=p09017049_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017050-1>50&nbsp;</b>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David. <b class=verse-num id=v09017051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. <b class=verse-num id=v09017052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron. <b class=verse-num id=v09017053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. <b class=verse-num id=v09017054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</p><p id=p09017054_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017055-1>55&nbsp;</b>As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, &#8220;Abner, whose son is this youth?&#8221; And Abner said, &#8220;As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017056-1>56&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Inquire whose son the boy is.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017057-1>57&nbsp;</b>And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09017058-1>58&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Whose son are you, young man?&#8221; And David answered, &#8220;I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&#8221;</p></div>

And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. <b class=verse-num id=v09018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Saul thought, &#8220;Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&#8221; Therefore Saul said to David a second time, &#8220;You shall now be my son-in-law.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Saul commanded his servants, &#8220;Speak to David in private and say, &#8216;Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king&#8217;s son-in-law.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Saul&#8217;s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, &#8220;Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king&#8217;s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the servants of Saul told him, &#8220;Thus and so did David speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, &#8220;Thus shall you say to David, &#8216;The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king&#8217;s enemies.&#8217;&#8221; Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king&#8217;s son-in-law. Before the time had expired, <b class=verse-num id=v09018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king&#8217;s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife. <b class=verse-num id=v09018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, loved him, <b class=verse-num id=v09018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David&#8217;s enemy continually.</p><p id=p09018029_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.</p></div>

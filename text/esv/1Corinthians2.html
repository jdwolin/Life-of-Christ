Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? <b class=verse-num id=v46001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, <b class=verse-num id=v46001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. <b class=verse-num id=v46001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>(I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) <b class=verse-num id=v46001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</p><h3 id=p46001017_07-1>Christ the Wisdom and Power of God</h3><p id=p46001017_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p46001019_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</span><br /><span id=p46001019_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p46001019_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v46001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? <b class=verse-num id=v46001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. <b class=verse-num id=v46001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, <b class=verse-num id=v46001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, <b class=verse-num id=v46001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p><p id=p46001025_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. <b class=verse-num id=v46001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; <b class=verse-num id=v46001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, <b class=verse-num id=v46001029-1>29&nbsp;</b>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46001030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, <b class=verse-num id=v46001031-1>31&nbsp;</b>so that, as it is written, &#8220;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&#8221;</p></div>

And even now you are not yet ready, <b class=verse-num id=v46003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way? <b class=verse-num id=v46003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For when one says, &#8220;I follow Paul,&#8221; and another, &#8220;I follow Apollos,&#8221; are you not being merely human?</p><p id=p46003004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. <b class=verse-num id=v46003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. <b class=verse-num id=v46003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. <b class=verse-num id=v46003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. <b class=verse-num id=v46003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers.

For God&#8217;s temple is holy, and you are that temple.</p><p id=p46003017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. <b class=verse-num id=v46003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, &#8220;He catches the wise in their craftiness,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and again, &#8220;The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, <b class=verse-num id=v46003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future&#8212;all are yours, <b class=verse-num id=v46003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and you are Christ&#8217;s, and Christ is God&#8217;s.</p></div>

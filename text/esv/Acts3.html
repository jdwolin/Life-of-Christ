together in one place. <b class=verse-num id=v44002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. <b class=verse-num id=v44002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p><p id=p44002004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v44002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. <b class=verse-num id=v44002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they were amazed and astonished, saying, &#8220;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? <b class=verse-num id=v44002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? <b class=verse-num id=v44002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <b class=verse-num id=v44002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, <b class=verse-num id=v44002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians&#8212;we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But others mocking said, &#8220;They are filled with new wine.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44002013_07-1>Peter&#8217;s Sermon at Pentecost</h3><p id=p44002013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: &#8220;Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. <b class=verse-num id=v44002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. <b class=verse-num id=v44002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But this is what was uttered

Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v44002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. <b class=verse-num id=v44002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. <b class=verse-num id=v44002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For David says concerning him,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44002025_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;I saw the Lord always before me,</span><br /><span id=p44002025_11-1

hope.</span><br /><span id=p44002027_11-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,</span><br /><span id=p44002027_11-1

class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44002028_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v44002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, <b class=verse-num id=v44002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. <b class=verse-num id=v44002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. <b class=verse-num id=v44002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. <b class=verse-num id=v44002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44002034_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</span><br /><span id=p44002034_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sit at my right hand,</span><br /><span id=p44002035_11-1 class=indent line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I make your enemies your footstool.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44002035_11-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.&#8221;</p><p id=p44002036_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to them, &#8220;Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v44002039-1>39&nbsp;</b>For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, &#8220;Save yourselves from this crooked generation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p><h3 id=p44002041_11-1>The Fellowship of the Believers</h3><p id=p44002041_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And they devoted themselves to the apostles&#8217; teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. <b class=verse-num id=v44002043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. <b class=verse-num id=v44002044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And all who believed were together and had all things in common. <b class=verse-num id=v44002045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. <b class=verse-num id=v44002046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, <b class=verse-num id=v44002047-1>47&nbsp;</b>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</p></div>

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. <b class=verse-num id=v44003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. <b class=verse-num id=v44003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And all the people saw him walking and praising God, <b class=verse-num id=v44003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms.

For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. <b class=verse-num id=v44004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But Peter and John answered them, &#8220;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, <b class=verse-num id=v44004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v44004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.</p><h3 id=p44004022_07-1>The Believers Pray for Boldness</h3><p id=p44004022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. <b class=verse-num id=v44004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, &#8220;Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, <b class=verse-num id=v44004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44004025_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Why did the Gentiles rage,</span><br /><span id=p44004025_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples plot in vain?</span><br /><span id=p44004026_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings of the earth set themselves,</span><br /><span id=p44004026_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rulers were gathered together,</span><br /><span id=p44004026_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the Lord and against his Anointed&#8217;&#8212;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44004026_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v44004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. <b class=verse-num id=v44004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, <b class=verse-num id=v44004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.</p><h3 id=p44004031_12-1>They Had Everything in Common</h3><p id=p44004031_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44004032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. <b class=verse-num id=v44004033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. <b class=verse-num id=v44004034-1>34&nbsp;</b>There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold <b class=verse-num id=v44004035-1>35&nbsp;</b>and laid it at the apostles&#8217; feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. <b class=verse-num id=v44004036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, <b class=verse-num id=v44004037-1>37&nbsp;</b>sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles&#8217; feet.</p></div>

Then declare to her all her abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself! <b class=verse-num id=v26022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought your days near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries. <b class=verse-num id=v26022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; your name is defiled; you are full of tumult.</p><p id=p26022005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood. <b class=verse-num id=v26022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you. <b class=verse-num id=v26022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths. <b class=verse-num id=v26022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you who eat on the mountains; they commit lewdness in your midst. <b class=verse-num id=v26022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In you men uncover their fathers&#8217; nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity. <b class=verse-num id=v26022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>One commits abomination with his neighbor&#8217;s wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you violates his sister, his father&#8217;s daughter. <b class=verse-num id=v26022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26022012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Behold, I strike my hand at the dishonest gain that you have made, and at the blood that has been in your midst. <b class=verse-num id=v26022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you?

They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. <b class=verse-num id=v26022027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain. <b class=verse-num id=v26022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, &#8216;Thus says the Lord GOD,&#8217; when the LORD has not spoken. <b class=verse-num id=v26022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice. <b class=verse-num id=v26022030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. <b class=verse-num id=v26022031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p></div>

And after she was defiled by them, she turned from them in disgust. <b class=verse-num id=v26023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister. <b class=verse-num id=v26023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt <b class=verse-num id=v26023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses. <b class=verse-num id=v26023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts.&#8221;</p><p id=p26023021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26023022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side: <b class=verse-num id=v26023023-1>23&nbsp;</b>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. <b class=verse-num id=v26023024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples.

Declare to them their abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26023037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me. <b class=verse-num id=v26023038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths. <b class=verse-num id=v26023039-1>39&nbsp;</b>For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, this is what they did in my house. <b class=verse-num id=v26023040-1>40&nbsp;</b>They even sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came.

When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.&#8217;</p><p id=p26024024_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v26024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul&#8217;s desire, and also their sons and daughters, <b class=verse-num id=v26024026-1>26&nbsp;</b>on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news. <b class=verse-num id=v26024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

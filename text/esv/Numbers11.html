Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <b class=verse-num id=v04010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But if they blow only one, then the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. <b class=verse-num id=v04010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not sound an alarm. <b class=verse-num id=v04010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations. <b class=verse-num id=v04010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v04010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be a reminder of you before your God: I am the LORD your God.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p04010010_04-1>Israel Leaves Sinai</h3><p id=p04010010_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony, <b class=verse-num id=v04010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and the people of Israel set out by stages from the wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran. <b class=verse-num id=v04010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>They set out for the first time at the command of the LORD by Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v04010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The standard of the camp of the people of Judah set out first by their companies, and over their company was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. <b class=verse-num id=v04010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. <b class=verse-num id=v04010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.</p><p id=p04010016_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who carried the tabernacle, set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out by their companies, and over their company was Elizur the son of Shedeur. <b class=verse-num id=v04010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. <b class=verse-num id=v04010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.</p><p id=p04010020_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival. <b class=verse-num id=v04010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the standard of the camp of the people of Ephraim set out by their companies, and over their company was Elishama the son of Ammihud. <b class=verse-num id=v04010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. <b class=verse-num id=v04010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.</p><p id=p04010024_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then the standard of the camp of the people of Dan, acting as the rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies, and over their company was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. <b class=verse-num id=v04010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. <b class=verse-num id=v04010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And over the company of the tribe of the people of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. <b class=verse-num id=v04010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies, when they set out.</p><p id=p04010028_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, &#8220;We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, &#8216;I will give it to you.&#8217; Come with us, and we will do good to you, for the LORD has promised good to Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But he said to him, &#8220;I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us. <b class=verse-num id=v04010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And if you do go with us, whatever good the LORD will do to us, the same will we do to you.&#8221;</p><p id=p04010032_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they set out from the mount of the LORD three days&#8217; journey. And the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days&#8217; journey, to seek out a resting place for them. <b class=verse-num id=v04010034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day, whenever they set out from the camp.</p><p id=p04010034_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v04010035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And whenever the ark set out, Moses said, &#8220;Arise, O LORD, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04010036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And when it rested, he said, &#8220;Return, O LORD, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.&#8221;</p></div>

And the people of Israel also wept again and said, &#8220;Oh that we had meat to eat! <b class=verse-num id=v04011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. <b class=verse-num id=v04011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.&#8221;</p><p id=p04011006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium. <b class=verse-num id=v04011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil. <b class=verse-num id=v04011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.</p><p id=p04011009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Moses heard the people weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased. <b class=verse-num id=v04011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Moses said to the LORD, &#8220;Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? <b class=verse-num id=v04011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, &#8216;Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing child,&#8217; to the land that you swore to give their fathers? <b class=verse-num id=v04011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, &#8216;Give us meat, that we may eat.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v04011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me. <b class=verse-num id=v04011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p04011015_04-1>Elders Appointed to Aid Moses</h3><p id=p04011015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you. <b class=verse-num id=v04011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone. <b class=verse-num id=v04011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And say to the people, &#8216;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, &#8220;Who will give us meat to eat? For it was better for us in Egypt.&#8221; Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat. <b class=verse-num id=v04011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, <b class=verse-num id=v04011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, &#8220;Why did we come out of Egypt?&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Moses said, &#8220;The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, &#8216;I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v04011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Is the LORD&#8217;s hand shortened? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not.&#8221;</p><p id=p04011023_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent. <b class=verse-num id=v04011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.</p><p id=p04011025_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And a young man ran and told Moses, &#8220;Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, &#8220;My lord Moses, stop them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But Moses said to him, &#8220;Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets, that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</p><h3 id=p04011030_09-1>Quail and a Plague</h3><p id=p04011030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v04011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then a wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day&#8217;s journey on this side and a day&#8217;s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v04011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague. <b class=verse-num id=v04011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving. <b class=verse-num id=v04011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.</p></div>

Has he not spoken through us also?&#8221; And the LORD heard it. <b class=verse-num id=v04012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v04012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, &#8220;Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.&#8221; And the three of them came out. <b class=verse-num id=v04012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward. <b class=verse-num id=v04012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream. <b class=verse-num id=v04012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house. <b class=verse-num id=v04012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.</p><p id=p04012009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. <b class=verse-num id=v04012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned. <b class=verse-num id=v04012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Moses cried to the LORD, &#8220;O God, please heal her&#8212;please.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days?

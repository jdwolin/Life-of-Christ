He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people. <b class=verse-num id=v03017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>This is to the end that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they sacrifice in the open field, that they may bring them to the LORD, to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v03017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the priest shall throw the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for a pleasing aroma to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v03017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they whore.

Therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off. <b class=verse-num id=v03017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And every person who eats what dies of itself or what is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean. <b class=verse-num id=v03017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But if he does not wash them or bathe his flesh, he shall bear his iniquity.&#8221;</p></div>

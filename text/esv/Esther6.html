<h3 id=p17005001_01-1>Esther Prepares a Banquet</h3><p id=p17005001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king&#8217;s palace, in front of the king&#8217;s quarters, while the king was sitting on his royal throne inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace. <b class=verse-num id=v17005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. <b class=verse-num id=v17005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Esther said, &#8220;If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the king said, &#8220;Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked.&#8221; So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared. <b class=verse-num id=v17005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Esther answered, &#8220;My wish and my request is: <b class=verse-num id=v17005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p17005008_05-1>Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai</h3><p id=p17005008_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v17005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#8217;s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. <b class=verse-num id=v17005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh. <b class=verse-num id=v17005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Haman said, &#8220;Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#8217;s gate.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#8220;Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast.&#8221; This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.</p></div>

And he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And it was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. <b class=verse-num id=v17006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&#8221; The king&#8217;s young men who attended him said, &#8220;Nothing has been done for him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Who is in the court?&#8221; Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king&#8217;s palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him. <b class=verse-num id=v17006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the king&#8217;s young men told him, &#8220;Haman is there, standing in the court.&#8221; And the king said, &#8220;Let him come in.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Haman came in, and the king said to him, &#8220;What should be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?&#8221; And Haman said to himself, &#8220;Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Haman said to the king, &#8220;For the man whom the king delights to honor, <b class=verse-num id=v17006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set. <b class=verse-num id=v17006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king&#8217;s most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city, proclaiming before him: &#8216;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Haman, &#8220;Hurry; take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king&#8217;s gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, &#8220;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.&#8221;</p><p id=p17006011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai returned to the king&#8217;s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. <b class=verse-num id=v17006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, &#8220;If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p17006013_05-1>Esther Reveals Haman&#8217;s Plot</h3><p id=p17006013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v17006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>While they were yet talking with him, the king&#8217;s eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the feast that Esther had prepared.</p></div>

<p id=p17007001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. <b class=verse-num id=v17007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Queen Esther answered, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request. <b class=verse-num id=v17007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, &#8220;Who is he, and where is he, who has dared to do this?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Esther said, &#8220;A foe and enemy!

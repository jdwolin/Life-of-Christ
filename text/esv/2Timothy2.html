But the word of God is not bound! <b class=verse-num id=v55002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <b class=verse-num id=v55002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The saying is trustworthy, for:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p55002011_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have died with him, we will also live with him;</span><br /><span id=p55002012_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v55002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;if we endure, we will also reign with him;</span><br /><span id=p55002012_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;if we deny him, he also will deny us;</span><br /><span id=p55002013_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v55002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;if we are faithless, he remains faithful&#8212;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p55002013_07-1 class=same-paragraph>for he cannot deny himself.</p><h3 id=p55002013_07-1>A Worker Approved by God</h3><p id=p55002013_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. <b class=verse-num id=v55002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. <b class=verse-num id=v55002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, <b class=verse-num id=v55002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <b class=verse-num id=v55002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. <b class=verse-num id=v55002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But God&#8217;s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are his,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.&#8221;</p><p id=p55002019_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. <b class=verse-num id=v55002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</p><p id=p55002021_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. <b class=verse-num id=v55002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. <b class=verse-num id=v55002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the Lord&#8217;s servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, <b class=verse-num id=v55002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, <b class=verse-num id=v55002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44016001_01-1>Timothy Joins Paul and Silas</h3><p id=p44016001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44016001-1>16:1&nbsp;</b>Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v44016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. <b class=verse-num id=v44016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v44016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.</p><h3 id=p44016005_06-1>The Macedonian Call</h3><p id=p44016005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. <b class=verse-num id=v44016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. <b class=verse-num id=v44016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. <b class=verse-num id=v44016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, &#8220;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p><h3 id=p44016010_09-1>The Conversion of Lydia</h3><p id=p44016010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, <b class=verse-num id=v44016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. <b class=verse-num id=v44016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. <b class=verse-num id=v44016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, &#8220;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&#8221; And she prevailed upon us.</p><h3 id=p44016015_13-1>Paul and Silas in Prison</h3><p id=p44016015_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. <b class=verse-num id=v44016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>She followed Paul and us, crying out, &#8220;These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &#8220;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&#8221; And it came out that very hour.</p><p id=p44016018_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. <b class=verse-num id=v44016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, &#8220;These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city. <b class=verse-num id=v44016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. <b class=verse-num id=v44016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely. <b class=verse-num id=v44016024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p><h3 id=p44016024_18-1>The Philippian Jailer Converted</h3><p id=p44016024_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016025-1>25&nbsp;</b>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, <b class=verse-num id=v44016026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&#8217;s bonds were unfastened. <b class=verse-num id=v44016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v44016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But Paul cried with a loud voice, &#8220;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. <b class=verse-num id=v44016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he brought them out and said, &#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. <b class=verse-num id=v44016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. <b class=verse-num id=v44016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.</p><p id=p44016034_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, &#8220;Let those men go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &#8220;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But Paul said to them, &#8220;They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. <b class=verse-num id=v44016039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. <b class=verse-num id=v44016040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.</p></div>

And some said, &#8220;What does this babbler wish to say?&#8221; Others said, &#8220;He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities&#8221;&#8212;because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. <b class=verse-num id=v44017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &#8220;May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <b class=verse-num id=v44017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.</p><h3 id=p44017021_14-1>Paul Addresses the Areopagus</h3><p id=p44017021_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: &#8220;Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. <b class=verse-num id=v44017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#8216;To the unknown god.&#8217; What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. <b class=verse-num id=v44017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, <b class=verse-num id=v44017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. <b class=verse-num id=v44017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, <b class=verse-num id=v44017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, <b class=verse-num id=v44017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44017028_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;In him we live and move and have our being&#8217;;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44017028_18-1 class=same-paragraph>as even some of your own poets have said,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44017028_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;For we are indeed his offspring.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44017028_18-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Being then God&#8217;s offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man. <b class=verse-num id=v44017030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, <b class=verse-num id=v44017031-1>31&nbsp;</b>because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.&#8221;</p><p id=p44017031_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44017032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked.

And he went to see them, <b class=verse-num id=v44018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. <b class=verse-num id=v44018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.</p><p id=p44018004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, &#8220;Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue. <b class=verse-num id=v44018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. <b class=verse-num id=v44018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44018010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p><p id=p44018011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal, <b class=verse-num id=v44018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &#8220;If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint. <b class=verse-num id=v44018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he drove them from the tribunal. <b class=verse-num id=v44018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.</p><h3 id=p44018017_04-1>Paul Returns to Antioch</h3><p id=p44018017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow. <b class=verse-num id=v44018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined. <b class=verse-num id=v44018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But on taking leave of them he said, &#8220;I will return to you if God wills,&#8221; and he set sail from Ephesus.</p><p id=p44018021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch. <b class=verse-num id=v44018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</p><h3 id=p44018023_08-1>Apollos Speaks Boldly in Ephesus</h3><p id=p44018023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus.

When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, <b class=verse-num id=v44018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</p></div>

<h3 id=p42005001_01-1>Jesus Calls the First Disciples</h3><p id=p42005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v42005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, <b class=verse-num id=v42005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. <b class=verse-num id=v42005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon&#8217;s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. <b class=verse-num id=v42005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class=woc>&#8220;Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Simon answered, &#8220;Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. <b class=verse-num id=v42005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. <b class=verse-num id=v42005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&#8217; knees, saying, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, <b class=verse-num id=v42005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</p><h3 id=p42005011_06-1>Jesus Cleanses a Leper</h3><p id=p42005011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v42005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, &#8220;Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;I will; be clean.&#8221;</span> And immediately the leprosy left him. <b class=verse-num id=v42005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he charged him to tell no one, but <span class=woc>&#8220;go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. <b class=verse-num id=v42005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.</p><h3 id=p42005016_10-1>Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h3><p id=p42005016_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v42005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal. <b class=verse-num id=v42005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v42005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v42005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when he saw their faith, he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, &#8220;Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why do you question in your hearts?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Which is easier, to say, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven you,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise and walk&#8217;?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;he said to the man who was paralyzed&#8212;<span class=woc>&#8220;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. <b class=verse-num id=v42005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, &#8220;We have seen extraordinary things today.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p42005026_14-1>Jesus Calls Levi</h3><p id=p42005026_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v42005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And leaving everything, he rose and followed him.</p><p id=p42005028_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v42005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, &#8220;Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42005032_17-1>A Question About Fasting</h3><p id=p42005032_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v42005033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005036-1>36&nbsp;</b>He also told them a parable: <span class=woc>&#8220;No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42005039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, &#8216;The old is good.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p></div>

And John, <b class=verse-num id=v42007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, &#8220;Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when the men had come to him, they said, &#8220;John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, &#8216;Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. <b class=verse-num id=v42007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42007023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42007023_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v42007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When John&#8217;s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: <span class=woc>&#8220;What did you go out into the wilderness to see?

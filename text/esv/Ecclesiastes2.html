<h3 id=p21002001_01-1>The Vanity of Self-Indulgence</h3><p id=p21002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v21002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>I said in my heart, &#8220;Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.&#8221; But behold, this also was vanity. <b class=verse-num id=v21002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I said of laughter, &#8220;It is mad,&#8221; and of pleasure, &#8220;What use is it?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v21002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine&#8212;my heart still guiding me with wisdom&#8212;and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life. <b class=verse-num id=v21002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself. <b class=verse-num id=v21002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees. <b class=verse-num id=v21002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees. <b class=verse-num id=v21002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v21002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.</p><p id=p21002008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. <b class=verse-num id=v21002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil. <b class=verse-num id=v21002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</p><h3 id=p21002011_05-1>The Vanity of Living Wisely</h3><p id=p21002011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v21002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done. <b class=verse-num id=v21002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness. <b class=verse-num id=v21002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them. <b class=verse-num id=v21002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then I said in my heart, &#8220;What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?&#8221; And I said in my heart that this also is vanity. <b class=verse-num id=v21002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool! <b class=verse-num id=v21002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</p><h3 id=p21002017_10-1>The Vanity of Toil</h3><p id=p21002017_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v21002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me, <b class=verse-num id=v21002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity. <b class=verse-num id=v21002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun, <b class=verse-num id=v21002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. <b class=verse-num id=v21002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun? <b class=verse-num id=v21002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</p><p id=p21002023_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v21002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God, <b class=verse-num id=v21002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment? <b class=verse-num id=v21002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p></div>

Also, he has put eternity into man&#8217;s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end. <b class=verse-num id=v21003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live; <b class=verse-num id=v21003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil&#8212;this is God&#8217;s gift to man.</p><p id=p21003013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v21003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him. <b class=verse-num id=v21003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.</p><h3 id=p21003015_08-1>From Dust to Dust</h3><p id=p21003015_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v21003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness. <b class=verse-num id=v21003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work. <b class=verse-num id=v21003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts. <b class=verse-num id=v21003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other.

<h3 id=p05018001_01-1>Provision for Priests and Levites</h3><p id=p05018001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The Levitical priests, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the LORD&#8217;s food offerings as their inheritance. <b class=verse-num id=v05018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them. <b class=verse-num id=v05018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And this shall be the priests&#8217; due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach. <b class=verse-num id=v05018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The firstfruits of your grain, of your wine and of your oil, and the first fleece of your sheep, you shall give him. <b class=verse-num id=v05018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for all time.</p><p id=p05018005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v05018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And if a Levite comes from any of your towns out of all Israel, where he lives&#8212;and he may come when he desires&#8212;to the place that the LORD will choose, <b class=verse-num id=v05018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and ministers in the name of the LORD his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand to minister there before the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v05018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>then he may have equal portions to eat, besides what he receives from the sale of his patrimony.</p><h3 id=p05018008_06-1>Abominable Practices</h3><p id=p05018008_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations. <b class=verse-num id=v05018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer <b class=verse-num id=v05018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead, <b class=verse-num id=v05018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD. And because of these abominations the LORD your God is driving them out before you. <b class=verse-num id=v05018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You shall be blameless before the LORD your God, <b class=verse-num id=v05018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>for these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do this.</p><h3 id=p05018014_08-1>A New Prophet like Moses</h3><p id=p05018014_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v05018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers&#8212;it is to him you shall listen&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, &#8216;Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to me, &#8216;They are right in what they have spoken. <b class=verse-num id=v05018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. <b class=verse-num id=v05018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. <b class=verse-num id=v05018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And if you say in your heart, &#8216;How may we know the word that the LORD has not spoken?&#8217;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.</p></div>

If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies&#8212;he may flee to one of these cities and live, <b class=verse-num id=v05019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past. <b class=verse-num id=v05019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities. <b class=verse-num id=v05019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways&#8212;then you shall add three other cities to these three, <b class=verse-num id=v05019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.</p><p id=p05019010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities, <b class=verse-num id=v05019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die. <b class=verse-num id=v05019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may be well with you.</p><h3 id=p05019013_06-1>Property Boundaries</h3><p id=p05019013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You shall not move your neighbor&#8217;s landmark, which the men of old have set, in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.</p><h3 id=p05019014_08-1>Laws Concerning Witnesses</h3><p id=p05019014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed.

Do not fear or panic or be in dread of them, <b class=verse-num id=v05020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for the LORD your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying, &#8216;Is there any man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. <b class=verse-num id=v05020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And is there any man who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit. <b class=verse-num id=v05020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And is there any man who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, &#8216;Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted?

<h3 id=p01026001_01-1>God&#8217;s Promise to Isaac</h3><p id=p01026001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01026001-1>26:1&nbsp;</b>Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v01026002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared to him and said, &#8220;Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. <b class=verse-num id=v01026003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father. <b class=verse-num id=v01026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, <b class=verse-num id=v01026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01026005_05-1>Isaac and Abimelech</h3><p id=p01026005_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Isaac settled in Gerar. <b class=verse-num id=v01026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, &#8220;She is my sister,&#8221; for he feared to say, &#8220;My wife,&#8221; thinking, &#8220;lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,&#8221; because she was attractive in appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v01026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech called Isaac and said, &#8220;Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;?&#8221; Isaac said to him, &#8220;Because I thought, &#8216;Lest I die because of her.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Abimelech said, &#8220;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, &#8220;Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&#8221;</p><p id=p01026011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him, <b class=verse-num id=v01026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy. <b class=verse-num id=v01026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him. <b class=verse-num id=v01026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father&#8217;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.) <b class=verse-num id=v01026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Isaac, &#8220;Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.&#8221;</p><p id=p01026016_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. <b class=verse-num id=v01026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them. <b class=verse-num id=v01026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But when Isaac&#8217;s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water, <b class=verse-num id=v01026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac&#8217;s herdsmen, saying, &#8220;The water is ours.&#8221; So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah. <b class=verse-num id=v01026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, &#8220;For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.&#8221;</p><p id=p01026022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>From there he went up to Beersheba. <b class=verse-num id=v01026024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, &#8220;I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham&#8217;s sake.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac&#8217;s servants dug a well.</p><p id=p01026025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army, <b class=verse-num id=v01026027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Isaac said to them, &#8220;Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026028-1>28&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you, <b class=verse-num id=v01026029-1>29&nbsp;</b>that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. <b class=verse-num id=v01026031-1>31&nbsp;</b>In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace. <b class=verse-num id=v01026032-1>32&nbsp;</b>That same day Isaac&#8217;s servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, &#8220;We have found water.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026033-1>33&nbsp;</b>He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.</p><p id=p01026033_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026034-1>34&nbsp;</b>When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <b class=verse-num id=v01026035-1>35&nbsp;</b>and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.</p></div>

So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, <b class=verse-num id=v01027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &#8220;I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, <b class=verse-num id=v01027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. <b class=verse-num id=v01027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. <b class=verse-num id=v01027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8220;Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <b class=verse-num id=v01027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027013-1>13&nbsp;</b>His mother said to him, &#8220;Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01027013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved. <b class=verse-num id=v01027015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. <b class=verse-num id=v01027016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. <b class=verse-num id=v01027017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p><p id=p01027017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So he went in to his father and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am. Who are you, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to his father, &#8220;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But Isaac said to his son, &#8220;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Because the LORD your God granted me success.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac said to Jacob, &#8220;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, &#8220;The voice is Jacob&#8217;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&#8217;s hands.

And he said to his father, &#8220;Let my father arise and eat of his son&#8217;s game, that you may bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027032-1>32&nbsp;</b>His father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, &#8220;Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, &#8220;Bless me, even me also, O my father!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Esau said, &#8220;Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Have you not reserved a blessing for me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Isaac answered and said to Esau, &#8220;Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Esau said to his father, &#8220;Have you but one blessing, my father?

This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&#8221;</p><p id=p01028017_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01028018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. <b class=verse-num id=v01028019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. <b class=verse-num id=v01028020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, &#8220;If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, <b class=verse-num id=v01028021-1>21&nbsp;</b>so that I come again to my father&#8217;s house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God, <b class=verse-num id=v01028022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God&#8217;s house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.&#8221;</p></div>

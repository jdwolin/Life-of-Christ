<h3 id=p45008001_01-1>Life in the Spirit</h3><p id=p45008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v45008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. <b class=verse-num id=v45008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, <b class=verse-num id=v45008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v45008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v45008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. <b class=verse-num id=v45008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God&#8217;s law; indeed, it cannot. <b class=verse-num id=v45008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</p><p id=p45008008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. <b class=verse-num id=v45008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p><h3 id=p45008011_05-1>Heirs with Christ</h3><p id=p45008011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v45008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. <b class=verse-num id=v45008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, &#8220;Abba! Father!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, <b class=verse-num id=v45008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and if children, then heirs&#8212;heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p><h3 id=p45008017_08-1>Future Glory</h3><p id=p45008017_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. <b class=verse-num id=v45008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope <b class=verse-num id=v45008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. <b class=verse-num id=v45008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <b class=verse-num id=v45008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? <b class=verse-num id=v45008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p><p id=p45008025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. <b class=verse-num id=v45008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. <b class=verse-num id=v45008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v45008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p><h3 id=p45008030_10-1>God&#8217;s Everlasting Love</h3><p id=p45008030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? <b class=verse-num id=v45008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? <b class=verse-num id=v45008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Who shall bring any charge against God&#8217;s elect? It is God who justifies. <b class=verse-num id=v45008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died&#8212;more than that, who was raised&#8212;who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. <b class=verse-num id=v45008035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? <b class=verse-num id=v45008036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45008036_13-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;For your sake we are being killed all the day long;</span><br /><span id=p45008036_13-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45008036_13-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v45008037-1>37&nbsp;</b>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <b class=verse-num id=v45008038-1>38&nbsp;</b>For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, <b class=verse-num id=v45008039-1>39&nbsp;</b>nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></div>

Amen.</p><p id=p45009005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v45009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but &#8220;Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. <b class=verse-num id=v45009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For this is what the promise said: &#8220;About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, <b class=verse-num id=v45009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad&#8212;in order that God&#8217;s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>she was told, &#8220;The older will serve the younger.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As it is written, &#8220;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&#8221;</p><p id=p45009013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&#8217;s part? By no means! <b class=verse-num id=v45009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For he says to Moses, &#8220;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. <b class=verse-num id=v45009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &#8220;For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.</p><p id=p45009018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You will say to me then, &#8220;Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, &#8220;Why have you made me like this?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? <b class=verse-num id=v45009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, <b class=verse-num id=v45009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? <b class=verse-num id=v45009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>As indeed he says in Hosea,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45009025_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Those who were not my people I will call &#8216;my people,&#8217;</span><br /><span id=p45009025_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her who was not beloved I will call &#8216;beloved.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45009026_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;And in the very place where it was said to them, &#8216;You are not my people,&#8217;</span><br /><span id=p45009026_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there they will be called &#8216;sons of the living God.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45009026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: &#8220;Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved, <b class=verse-num id=v45009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And as Isaiah predicted,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45009029_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring,</span><br /><span id=p45009029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would have been like Sodom</span><br /><span id=p45009029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and become like Gomorrah.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p45009029_04-1>Israel&#8217;s Unbelief</h3><p id=p45009029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>What shall we say, then?

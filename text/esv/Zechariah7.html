<h3 id=p38006001_01-1>A Vision of Four Chariots</h3><p id=p38006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v38006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v38006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, <b class=verse-num id=v38006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses&#8212;all of them strong. <b class=verse-num id=v38006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, &#8220;What are these, my lord?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v38006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the angel answered and said to me, &#8220;These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v38006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v38006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, &#8220;Go, patrol the earth.&#8221; So they patrolled the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v38006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he cried to me, &#8220;Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p38006008_06-1>The Crown and the Temple</h3><p id=p38006008_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v38006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v38006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah. <b class=verse-num id=v38006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. <b class=verse-num id=v38006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &#8220;Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: for he shall branch out from his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v38006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. And there shall be a priest on his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v38006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD as a reminder to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.</p><p id=p38006014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v38006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the LORD. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p38008001_01-1>The Coming Peace and Prosperity of Zion</h3><p id=p38008001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v38008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v38008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath. <b class=verse-num id=v38008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v38008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age. <b class=verse-num id=v38008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. <b class=verse-num id=v38008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the LORD of hosts? <b class=verse-num id=v38008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country, <b class=verse-num id=v38008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.

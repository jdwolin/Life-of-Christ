Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity. <b class=verse-num id=v26036018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it. <b class=verse-num id=v26036019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries.

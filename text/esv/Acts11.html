<h3 id=p44010001_01-1>Peter and Cornelius</h3><p id=p44010001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort, <b class=verse-num id=v44010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God. <b class=verse-num id=v44010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, &#8220;Cornelius.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he stared at him in terror and said, &#8220;What is it, Lord?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. <b class=verse-num id=v44010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter. <b class=verse-num id=v44010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him, <b class=verse-num id=v44010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</p><h3 id=p44010008_04-1>Peter&#8217;s Vision</h3><p id=p44010008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. <b class=verse-num id=v44010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance <b class=verse-num id=v44010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v44010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. <b class=verse-num id=v44010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And there came a voice to him: <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But Peter said, &#8220;By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the voice came to him again a second time, <span class=woc>&#8220;What God has made clean, do not call common.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.</p><p id=p44010016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon&#8217;s house, stood at the gate <b class=verse-num id=v44010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there. <b class=verse-num id=v44010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, &#8220;Behold, three men are looking for you. <b class=verse-num id=v44010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Peter went down to the men and said, &#8220;I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So he invited them in to be his guests.</p><p id=p44010023_06-1>The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <b class=verse-num id=v44010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Peter lifted him up, saying, &#8220;Stand up; I too am a man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered. <b class=verse-num id=v44010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v44010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.&#8221;</p><p id=p44010029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Cornelius said, &#8220;Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing <b class=verse-num id=v44010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8216;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. <b class=verse-num id=v44010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44010033_06-1>Gentiles Hear the Good News</h3><p id=p44010033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So Peter opened his mouth and said: &#8220;Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, <b class=verse-num id=v44010035-1>35&nbsp;</b>but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), <b class=verse-num id=v44010037-1>37&nbsp;</b>you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: <b class=verse-num id=v44010038-1>38&nbsp;</b>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, <b class=verse-num id=v44010040-1>40&nbsp;</b>but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, <b class=verse-num id=v44010041-1>41&nbsp;</b>not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44010042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44010043-1>43&nbsp;</b>To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44010043_11-1>The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles</h3><p id=p44010043_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010044-1>44&nbsp;</b>While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. <b class=verse-num id=v44010045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. <b class=verse-num id=v44010046-1>46&nbsp;</b>For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, <b class=verse-num id=v44010047-1>47&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44011001_01-1>Peter Reports to the Church</h3><p id=p44011001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v44011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Peter began and explained it to them in order: <b class=verse-num id=v44011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me. <b class=verse-num id=v44011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. <b class=verse-num id=v44011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I heard a voice saying to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But I said, &#8216;By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But the voice answered a second time from heaven, <span class=woc>&#8216;What God has made clean, do not call common.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v44011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. <b class=verse-num id=v44011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v44011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, &#8216;Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter; <b class=verse-num id=v44011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. <b class=verse-num id=v44011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, <span class=woc>&#8216;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God&#8217;s way?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, &#8220;Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44011018_06-1>The Church in Antioch</h3><p id=p44011018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. <b class=verse-num id=v44011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, <b class=verse-num id=v44011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, <b class=verse-num id=v44011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.</p><p id=p44011026_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. <b class=verse-num id=v44011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius). <b class=verse-num id=v44011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. <b class=verse-num id=v44011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44012001_01-1>James Killed and Peter Imprisoned</h3><p id=p44012001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. <b class=verse-num id=v44012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He killed James the brother of John with the sword, <b class=verse-num id=v44012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. <b class=verse-num id=v44012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v44012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</p><h3 id=p44012005_06-1>Peter Is Rescued</h3><p id=p44012005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. <b class=verse-num id=v44012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, &#8220;Get up quickly.&#8221; And the chains fell off his hands. <b class=verse-num id=v44012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the angel said to him, &#8220;Dress yourself and put on your sandals.&#8221; And he did so. And he said to him, &#8220;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. <b class=verse-num id=v44012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him. <b class=verse-num id=v44012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Peter came to himself, he said, &#8220;Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.&#8221;</p><p id=p44012011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. <b class=verse-num id=v44012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. <b class=verse-num id=v44012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Recognizing Peter&#8217;s voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v44012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They said to her, &#8220;You are out of your mind.&#8221; But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, &#8220;It is his angel!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. <b class=verse-num id=v44012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, &#8220;Tell these things to James and to the brothers.&#8221; Then he departed and went to another place.</p><p id=p44012017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. <b class=verse-num id=v44012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death.

<h3 id=p07017001_01-1>Micah and the Levite</h3><p id=p07017001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <b class=verse-num id=v07017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to his mother, &#8220;The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.&#8221; And his mother said, &#8220;Blessed be my son by the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, &#8220;I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah. <b class=verse-num id=v07017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest. <b class=verse-num id=v07017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</p><p id=p07017006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. <b class=verse-num id=v07017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. <b class=verse-num id=v07017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Micah said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Micah said to him, &#8220;Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living.&#8221; And the Levite went in. <b class=verse-num id=v07017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. <b class=verse-num id=v07017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. <b class=verse-num id=v07017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Micah said, &#8220;Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p07018001_01-1>Danites Take the Levite and the Idol</h3><p id=p07018001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them. <b class=verse-num id=v07018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, &#8220;Go and explore the land.&#8221; And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. <b class=verse-num id=v07018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, &#8220;Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;This is how Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the priest said to them, &#8220;Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p07018006_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. <b class=verse-num id=v07018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when they came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, &#8220;What do you report?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land. <b class=verse-num id=v07018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As soon as you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is spacious, for God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.&#8221;</p><p id=p07018010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So 600 men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, <b class=verse-num id=v07018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. <b class=verse-num id=v07018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</p><p id=p07018013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, &#8220;Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him about his welfare. <b class=verse-num id=v07018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the 600 men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v07018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war. <b class=verse-num id=v07018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when these went into Micah&#8217;s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;Keep quiet; put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the priest&#8217;s heart was glad. He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.</p><p id=p07018020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the livestock and the goods in front of them. <b class=verse-num id=v07018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah&#8217;s house were called out, and they overtook the people of Dan. <b class=verse-num id=v07018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they shouted to the people of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, &#8220;What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;You take my gods that I made and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, &#8216;What is the matter with you?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the people of Dan said to him, &#8220;Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.</p><p id=p07018026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But the people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v07018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it. <b class=verse-num id=v07018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laish at the first. <b class=verse-num id=v07018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v07018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So they set up Micah&#8217;s carved image that he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.</p></div>

<h3 id=p07019001_01-1>A Levite and His Concubine</h3><p id=p07019001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v07019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And his concubine was unfaithful to him, and she went away from him to her father&#8217;s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months. <b class=verse-num id=v07019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father&#8217;s house. And when the girl&#8217;s father saw him, he came with joy to meet him. <b class=verse-num id=v07019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And his father-in-law, the girl&#8217;s father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there. <b class=verse-num id=v07019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl&#8217;s father said to his son-in-law, &#8220;Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl&#8217;s father said to the man, &#8220;Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again. <b class=verse-num id=v07019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl&#8217;s father said, &#8220;Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines.&#8221; So they ate, both of them. <b class=verse-num id=v07019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl&#8217;s father, said to him, &#8220;Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home.&#8221;</p><p id=p07019009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v07019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, &#8220;Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And his master said to him, &#8220;We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said to his young man, &#8220;Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, <b class=verse-num id=v07019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night.</p><p id=p07019015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibeah. The men of the place were Benjaminites. <b class=verse-num id=v07019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city. And the old man said, &#8220;Where are you going? And where do you come from?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to the house of the LORD, but no one has taken me into his house. <b class=verse-num id=v07019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>We have straw and feed for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants. There is no lack of anything.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the old man said, &#8220;Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants. Only, do not spend the night in the square.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</p><h3 id=p07019021_06-1>Gibeah&#8217;s Crime</h3><p id=p07019021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, &#8220;Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, &#8220;No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing. <b class=verse-num id=v07019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Violate them and do with them what seems good to you, but against this man do not do this outrageous thing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. <b class=verse-num id=v07019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man&#8217;s house where her master was, until it was light.</p><p id=p07019026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. <b class=verse-num id=v07019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>He said to her, &#8220;Get up, let us be going.&#8221; But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went away to his home. <b class=verse-num id=v07019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v07019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And all who saw it said, &#8220;Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.&#8221;</p></div>

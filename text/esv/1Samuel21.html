<h3 id=p09020001_01-1>Jonathan Warns David</h3><p id=p09020001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09020001-1>20:1&nbsp;</b>Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, &#8220;What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this from me? It is not so.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But David vowed again, saying, &#8220;Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, &#8216;Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.&#8217; But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Whatever you say, I will do for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>David said to Jonathan, &#8220;Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening. <b class=verse-num id=v09020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>If your father misses me at all, then say, &#8216;David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>If he says, &#8216;Good!&#8217; it will be well with your servant, but if he is angry, then know that harm is determined by him. <b class=verse-num id=v09020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan said, &#8220;Far be it from you! If I knew that it was determined by my father that harm should come to you, would I not tell you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Jonathan, &#8220;Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Come, let us go out into the field.&#8221; So they both went out into the field.</p><p id=p09020011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan said to David, &#8220;The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you? <b class=verse-num id=v09020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But should it please my father to do you harm, the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father. <b class=verse-num id=v09020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die; <b class=verse-num id=v09020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, &#8220;May the LORD take vengeance on David&#8217;s enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p><p id=p09020017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said to him, &#8220;Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. <b class=verse-num id=v09020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap. <b class=verse-num id=v09020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark. <b class=verse-num id=v09020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And behold, I will send the boy, saying, &#8216;Go, find the arrows.&#8217; If I say to the boy, &#8216;Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,&#8217; then you are to come, for, as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger. <b class=verse-num id=v09020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But if I say to the youth, &#8216;Look, the arrows are beyond you,&#8217; then go, for the LORD has sent you away. <b class=verse-num id=v09020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.&#8221;</p><p id=p09020023_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09020024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food. <b class=verse-num id=v09020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul&#8217;s side, but David&#8217;s place was empty.</p><p id=p09020025_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, &#8220;Something has happened to him. He is not clean; surely he is not clean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David&#8217;s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, &#8220;Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Jonathan answered Saul, &#8220;David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem. <b class=verse-num id=v09020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8216;Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.&#8217; For this reason he has not come to the king&#8217;s table.&#8221;</p><p id=p09020029_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09020030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Saul&#8217;s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, &#8220;You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother&#8217;s nakedness? <b class=verse-num id=v09020031-1>31&nbsp;</b>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, &#8220;Why should he be put to death? What has he done?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. <b class=verse-num id=v09020034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.</p><p id=p09020034_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09020035-1>35&nbsp;</b>In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little boy. <b class=verse-num id=v09020036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And he said to his boy, &#8220;Run and find the arrows that I shoot.&#8221; As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <b class=verse-num id=v09020037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, &#8220;Is not the arrow beyond you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan called after the boy, &#8220;Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!&#8221; So Jonathan&#8217;s boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master. <b class=verse-num id=v09020039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v09020040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, &#8220;Go and carry them to the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09020041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the most. <b class=verse-num id=v09020042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, &#8216;The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.&#8217;&#8221; And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09021001_01-1>David and the Holy Bread</h3><p id=p09021001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09021001-1>21:1&nbsp;</b>Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David, trembling, and said to him, &#8220;Why are you alone, and no one with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, &#8220;The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, &#8216;Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.&#8217; I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place. <b class=verse-num id=v09021003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the priest answered David, &#8220;I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread&#8212;if the young men have kept themselves from women.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David answered the priest, &#8220;Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.</p><p id=p09021006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul&#8217;s herdsmen.</p><p id=p09021007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Ahimelech, &#8220;Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&#8217;s business required haste.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the priest said, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.&#8221; And David said, &#8220;There is none like that; give it to me.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p09021009_06-1>David Flees to Gath</h3><p id=p09021009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath. <b class=verse-num id=v09021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;Is not this David the king of the land?

<h3 id=p09022001_01-1>David at the Cave of Adullam</h3><p id=p09022001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father&#8217;s house heard it, they went down there to him. <b class=verse-num id=v09022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.</p><p id=p09022002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, &#8220;Please let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. <b class=verse-num id=v09022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the prophet Gad said to David, &#8220;Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.&#8221; So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.</p><h3 id=p09022005_07-1>Saul Kills the Priests at Nob</h3><p id=p09022005_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. <b class=verse-num id=v09022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, &#8220;Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, <b class=verse-num id=v09022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, &#8220;I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, <b class=verse-num id=v09022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.&#8221;</p><p id=p09022010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&#8217;s house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king. <b class=verse-num id=v09022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;Hear now, son of Ahitub.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Here I am, my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimelech answered the king, &#8220;And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king&#8217;s son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house? <b class=verse-num id=v09022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the guard who stood about him, &#8220;Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.&#8221; But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Doeg, &#8220;You turn and strike the priests.&#8221; And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v09022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.</p><p id=p09022019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. <b class=verse-num id=v09022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abiathar, &#8220;I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul.

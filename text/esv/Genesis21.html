<h3 id=p01020001_01-1>Abraham and Abimelech</h3><p id=p01020001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01020001-1>20:1&nbsp;</b>From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. <b class=verse-num id=v01020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. <b class=verse-num id=v01020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, &#8220;Lord, will you kill an innocent people? <b class=verse-num id=v01020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Did he not himself say to me, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;? And she herself said, &#8216;He is my brother.&#8217; In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then God said to him in the dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. <b class=verse-num id=v01020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now then, return the man&#8217;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.&#8221;</p><p id=p01020007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v01020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &#8220;What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What did you see, that you did this thing?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Abraham said, &#8220;I did it because I thought, &#8216;There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when God caused me to wander from my father&#8217;s house, I said to her, &#8216;This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, &#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01020013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said, &#8220;Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>To Sarah he said, &#8220;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. <b class=verse-num id=v01020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham&#8217;s wife.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01021001_01-1>The Birth of Isaac</h3><p id=p01021001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01021001-1>21:1&nbsp;</b>The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. <b class=verse-num id=v01021002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01021003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v01021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <b class=verse-num id=v01021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Sarah said, &#8220;God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01021007_05-1>God Protects Hagar and Ishmael</h3><p id=p01021007_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. <b class=verse-num id=v01021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing. <b class=verse-num id=v01021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So she said to Abraham, &#8220;Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But God said to Abraham, &#8220;Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. <b class=verse-num id=v01021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p><p id=p01021014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. <b class=verse-num id=v01021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, &#8220;Let me not look on the death of the child.&#8221; And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. <b class=verse-num id=v01021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, &#8220;What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. <b class=verse-num id=v01021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. <b class=verse-num id=v01021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. <b class=verse-num id=v01021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</p><h3 id=p01021021_10-1>A Treaty with Abimelech</h3><p id=p01021021_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, &#8220;God is with you in all that you do. <b class=verse-num id=v01021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Abraham said, &#8220;I will swear.&#8221;</p><p id=p01021024_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech&#8217;s servants had seized, <b class=verse-num id=v01021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Abimelech said, &#8220;I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v01021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. <b class=verse-num id=v01021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath. <b class=verse-num id=v01021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v01021033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. <b class=verse-num id=v01021034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01022001_01-1>The Sacrifice of Isaac</h3><p id=p01022001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, &#8220;Abraham!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. <b class=verse-num id=v01022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. <b class=verse-num id=v01022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham said to his young men, &#8220;Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. <b class=verse-num id=v01022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Isaac said to his father Abraham, &#8220;My father!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am, my son.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Abraham said, &#8220;God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&#8221; So they went both of them together.</p><p id=p01022008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. <b class=verse-num id=v01022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, &#8220;Abraham, Abraham!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Abraham called the name of that place, &#8220;The LORD will provide&#8221;; as it is said to this day, &#8220;On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.&#8221;</p><p id=p01022014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven <b class=verse-num id=v01022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, <b class=verse-num id=v01022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore.

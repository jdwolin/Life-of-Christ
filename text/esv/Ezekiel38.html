And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. <b class=verse-num id=v26037008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them. <b class=verse-num id=v26037009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26037010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</p><p id=p26037010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26037011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, &#8216;Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26037012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26037013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. <b class=verse-num id=v26037014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26037014_06-1>I Will Be Their God; They Shall Be My People</h3><p id=p26037014_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v26037015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26037016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, take a stick and write on it, &#8216;For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him&#8217;; then take another stick and write on it, &#8216;For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26037017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v26037018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when your people say to you, &#8216;Will you not tell us what you mean by these?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26037019-1>19&nbsp;</b>say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand. <b class=verse-num id=v26037020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, <b class=verse-num id=v26037021-1>21&nbsp;</b>then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land. <b class=verse-num id=v26037022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms. <b class=verse-num id=v26037023-1>23&nbsp;</b>They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p><p id=p26037023_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v26037024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes. <b class=verse-num id=v26037025-1>25&nbsp;</b>They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children&#8217;s children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever. <b class=verse-num id=v26037026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore. <b class=verse-num id=v26037027-1>27&nbsp;</b>My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <b class=verse-num id=v26037028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.&#8221;</p></div>

In the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land whose people were gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely, all of them. <b class=verse-num id=v26038009-1>9&nbsp;</b>You will advance, coming on like a storm.

I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26038012-1>12&nbsp;</b>to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v26038013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, &#8216;Have you come to seize spoil?

And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v26038021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. Every man&#8217;s sword will be against his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v26038022-1>22&nbsp;</b>With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur. <b class=verse-num id=v26038023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations.

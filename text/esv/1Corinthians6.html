<h3 id=p46005001_01-1>Sexual Immorality Defiles the Church</h3><p id=p46005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father&#8217;s wife. <b class=verse-num id=v46005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.</p><p id=p46005002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. <b class=verse-num id=v46005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v46005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p><p id=p46005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? <b class=verse-num id=v46005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. <b class=verse-num id=v46005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p><p id=p46005008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. <b class=verse-num id=v46005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler&#8212;not even to eat with such a one. <b class=verse-num id=v46005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? <b class=verse-num id=v46005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>God judges those outside. &#8220;Purge the evil person from among you.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p46006001_01-1>Lawsuits Against Believers</h3><p id=p46006001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? <b class=verse-num id=v46006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? <b class=verse-num id=v46006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life! <b class=verse-num id=v46006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church? <b class=verse-num id=v46006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers, <b class=verse-num id=v46006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? <b class=verse-num id=v46006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? <b class=verse-num id=v46006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But you yourselves wrong and defraud&#8212;even your own brothers!</p><p id=p46006008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, <b class=verse-num id=v46006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p><h3 id=p46006011_04-1>Flee Sexual Immorality</h3><p id=p46006011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v46006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;All things are lawful for me,&#8221; but not all things are helpful. &#8220;All things are lawful for me,&#8221; but I will not be dominated by anything. <b class=verse-num id=v46006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food&#8221;&#8212;and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. <b class=verse-num id=v46006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. <b class=verse-num id=v46006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! <b class=verse-num id=v46006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. <b class=verse-num id=v46006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. <b class=verse-num id=v46006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, <b class=verse-num id=v46006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46007001_01-1>Principles for Marriage</h3><p id=p46007001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: &#8220;It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. <b class=verse-num id=v46007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v46007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. <b class=verse-num id=v46007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p><p id=p46007005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. <b class=verse-num id=v46007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.</p><p id=p46007007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. <b class=verse-num id=v46007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p><p id=p46007009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband <b class=verse-num id=v46007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>(but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.</p><p id=p46007011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. <b class=verse-num id=v46007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. <b class=verse-num id=v46007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <b class=verse-num id=v46007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. <b class=verse-num id=v46007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</p><h3 id=p46007016_04-1>Live as You Are Called</h3><p id=p46007016_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches. <b class=verse-num id=v46007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. <b class=verse-num id=v46007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called. <b class=verse-num id=v46007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.) <b class=verse-num id=v46007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a bondservant of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. <b class=verse-num id=v46007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.</p><h3 id=p46007024_09-1>The Unmarried and the Widowed</h3><p id=p46007024_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord&#8217;s mercy is trustworthy. <b class=verse-num id=v46007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. <b class=verse-num id=v46007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <b class=verse-num id=v46007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <b class=verse-num id=v46007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <b class=verse-num id=v46007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <b class=verse-num id=v46007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p><p id=p46007031_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007032-1>32&nbsp;</b>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46007033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <b class=verse-num id=v46007034-1>34&nbsp;</b>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v46007035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p><p id=p46007035_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007036-1>36&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry&#8212;it is no sin. <b class=verse-num id=v46007037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <b class=verse-num id=v46007038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p><p id=p46007038_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007039-1>39&nbsp;</b>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46007040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</p></div>

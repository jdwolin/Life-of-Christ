<h3 id=p01011001_01-1>The Tower of Babel</h3><p id=p01011001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. <b class=verse-num id=v01011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. <b class=verse-num id=v01011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they said to one another, &#8220;Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&#8221; And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. <b class=verse-num id=v01011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then they said, &#8220;Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. <b class=verse-num id=v01011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said, &#8220;Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. <b class=verse-num id=v01011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another&#8217;s speech.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. <b class=verse-num id=v01011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth.

When they came to the land of Canaan, <b class=verse-num id=v01012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh.

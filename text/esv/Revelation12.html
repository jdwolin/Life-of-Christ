If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed. <b class=verse-num id=v66011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire. <b class=verse-num id=v66011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, <b class=verse-num id=v66011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. <b class=verse-num id=v66011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, <b class=verse-num id=v66011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v66011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. <b class=verse-num id=v66011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &#8220;Come up here!&#8221; And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. <b class=verse-num id=v66011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p><p id=p66011013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v66011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.</p><h3 id=p66011014_04-1>The Seventh Trumpet</h3><p id=p66011014_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v66011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v66011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, <b class=verse-num id=v66011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>saying,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p66011017_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,</span><br /><span id=p66011017_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is and who was,</span><br /><span id=p66011017_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for you have taken your great power</span><br /><span id=p66011017_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and begun to reign.</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v66011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The nations raged,</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but your wrath came,</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the time for the dead to be judged,</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who fear your name,</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both small and great,</span><br /><span id=p66011018_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p66011018_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v66011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then God&#8217;s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.

And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it. <b class=verse-num id=v66012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>She gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, <b class=verse-num id=v66012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for 1,260 days.</p><h3 id=p66012006_06-1>Satan Thrown Down to Earth</h3><p id=p66012006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v66012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back, <b class=verse-num id=v66012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v66012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world&#8212;he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. <b class=verse-num id=v66012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, &#8220;Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. <b class=verse-num id=v66012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. <b class=verse-num id=v66012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!&#8221;</p><p id=p66012012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v66012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. <b class=verse-num id=v66012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. <b class=verse-num id=v66012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood. <b class=verse-num id=v66012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v66012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p40019009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, &#8220;If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40019012_04-1>Let the Children Come to Me</h3><p id=p40019012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, <b class=verse-num id=v40019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he laid his hands on them and went away.</p><h3 id=p40019015_10-1>The Rich Young Man</h3><p id=p40019015_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And behold, a man came up to him, saying, &#8220;Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He said to him, &#8220;Which ones?&#8221; And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The young man said to him, &#8220;All these I have kept. What do I still lack?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</p><p id=p40019022_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, &#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Jesus looked at them and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then Peter said in reply, &#8220;See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&#8217;s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span></p></div>

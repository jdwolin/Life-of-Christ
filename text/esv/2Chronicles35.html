And he broke in pieces the Asherim and the carved and the metal images, and he made dust of them and scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. <b class=verse-num id=v14034005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14034006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around, <b class=verse-num id=v14034007-1>7&nbsp;</b>he broke down the altars and beat the Asherim and the images into powder and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.</p><h3 id=p14034007_05-1>The Book of the Law Found</h3><p id=p14034007_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v14034008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14034009-1>9&nbsp;</b>They came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14034010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they gave it to the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD. And the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD gave it for repairing and restoring the house. <b class=verse-num id=v14034011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let go to ruin. <b class=verse-num id=v14034012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music, <b class=verse-num id=v14034013-1>13&nbsp;</b>were over the burden-bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service, and some of the Levites were scribes and officials and gatekeepers.</p><p id=p14034013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v14034014-1>14&nbsp;</b>While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given through Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v14034015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the secretary, &#8220;I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.&#8221; And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan. <b class=verse-num id=v14034016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, &#8220;All that was committed to your servants they are doing. <b class=verse-num id=v14034017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14034018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, &#8220;Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.&#8221; And Shaphan read from it before the king.</p><p id=p14034018_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v14034019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes. <b class=verse-num id=v14034020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king&#8217;s servant, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14034021-1>21&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14034021_11-1>Huldah Prophesies Disaster</h3><p id=p14034021_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14034022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect. <b class=verse-num id=v14034023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And she said to them, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: &#8216;Tell the man who sent you to me, <b class=verse-num id=v14034024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that was read before the king of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14034025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched. <b class=verse-num id=v14034026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard, <b class=verse-num id=v14034027-1>27&nbsp;</b>because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14034028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.&#8217;&#8221; And they brought back word to the king.</p><p id=p14034028_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14034029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14034030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites, all the people both great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14034031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. <b class=verse-num id=v14034032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin join in it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14034033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Josiah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel and made all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14035001_01-1>Josiah Keeps the Passover</h3><p id=p14035001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14035001-1>35:1&nbsp;</b>Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem. And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month. <b class=verse-num id=v14035002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14035003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the LORD, &#8220;Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. You need not carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14035004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Prepare yourselves according to your fathers&#8217; houses by your divisions, as prescribed in the writing of David king of Israel and the document of Solomon his son. <b class=verse-num id=v14035005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And stand in the Holy Place according to the groupings of the fathers&#8217; houses of your brothers the lay people, and according to the division of the Levites by fathers&#8217; household. <b class=verse-num id=v14035006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And slaughter the Passover lamb, and consecrate yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses.&#8221;</p><p id=p14035006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14035007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Josiah contributed to the lay people, as Passover offerings for all who were present, lambs and young goats from the flock to the number of 30,000, and 3,000 bulls; these were from the king&#8217;s possessions. <b class=verse-num id=v14035008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And his officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 Passover lambs and 300 bulls. <b class=verse-num id=v14035009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 bulls.</p><p id=p14035009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14035010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king&#8217;s command. <b class=verse-num id=v14035011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests threw the blood that they received from them while the Levites flayed the sacrifices. <b class=verse-num id=v14035012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers&#8217; houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls. <b class=verse-num id=v14035013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the rule; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people. <b class=verse-num id=v14035014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. <b class=verse-num id=v14035015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king&#8217;s seer; and the gatekeepers were at each gate. They did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.</p><p id=p14035015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14035016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah. <b class=verse-num id=v14035017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v14035018-1>18&nbsp;</b>No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as was kept by Josiah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14035019-1>19&nbsp;</b>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.</p><h3 id=p14035019_05-1>Josiah Killed in Battle</h3><p id=p14035019_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14035020-1>20&nbsp;</b>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to meet him. <b class=verse-num id=v14035021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But he sent envoys to him, saying, &#8220;What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war. And God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14035022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, Josiah did not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight in the plain of Megiddo. <b class=verse-num id=v14035023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the archers shot King Josiah. And the king said to his servants, &#8220;Take me away, for I am badly wounded.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14035024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. <b class=verse-num id=v14035025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made these a rule in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments. <b class=verse-num id=v14035026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the Law of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v14035027-1>27&nbsp;</b>and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</p></div>

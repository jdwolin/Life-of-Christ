<h3 id=p43004001_01-1>Jesus and the Woman of Samaria</h3><p id=p43004001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John <b class=verse-num id=v43004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), <b class=verse-num id=v43004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. <b class=verse-num id=v43004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he had to pass through Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v43004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v43004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Jacob&#8217;s well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p><p id=p43004006_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Give me a drink.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>(For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) <b class=verse-num id=v43004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The Samaritan woman said to him, &#8220;How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?&#8221; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) <b class=verse-num id=v43004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered her, <span class=woc>&#8220;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, &#8216;Give me a drink,&#8217; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? <b class=verse-num id=v43004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.&#8221;</p><p id=p43004015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go, call your husband, and come here.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The woman answered him, &#8220;I have no husband.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are right in saying, &#8216;I have no husband&#8217;;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v43004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The woman said to him, &#8220;I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;I who speak to you am he.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43004026_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, &#8220;What do you seek?&#8221; or, &#8220;Why are you talking with her?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, <b class=verse-num id=v43004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>They went out of the town and were coming to him.</p><p id=p43004030_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, eat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I have food to eat that you do not know about.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So the disciples said to one another, &#8220;Has anyone brought him something to eat?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do you not say, &#8216;There are yet four months, then comes the harvest&#8217;? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Already</span> <span class=woc>the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For here the saying holds true, &#8216;One sows and another reaps.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43004038_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman&#8217;s testimony, &#8220;He told me all that I ever did.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. <b class=verse-num id=v43004041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And many more believed because of his word. <b class=verse-num id=v43004042-1>42&nbsp;</b>They said to the woman, &#8220;It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.&#8221;</p><p id=p43004042_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004043-1>43&nbsp;</b>After the two days he departed for Galilee. <b class=verse-num id=v43004044-1>44&nbsp;</b>(For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) <b class=verse-num id=v43004045-1>45&nbsp;</b>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast.</p><h3 id=p43004045_07-1>Jesus Heals an Official&#8217;s Son</h3><p id=p43004045_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004046-1>46&nbsp;</b>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. <b class=verse-num id=v43004047-1>47&nbsp;</b>When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <b class=verse-num id=v43004048-1>48&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004049-1>49&nbsp;</b>The official said to him, &#8220;Sir, come down before my child dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go; your son will live.&#8221;</span> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. <b class=verse-num id=v43004051-1>51&nbsp;</b>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. <b class=verse-num id=v43004052-1>52&nbsp;</b>So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, &#8220;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004053-1>53&nbsp;</b>The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Your son will live.&#8221;</span> And he himself believed, and all his household. <b class=verse-num id=v43004054-1>54&nbsp;</b>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</p></div>

<h3 id=p43005001_01-1>The Healing at the Pool on the Sabbath</h3><p id=p43005001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p43005001_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v43005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. <b class=verse-num id=v43005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>In these lay a multitude of invalids&#8212;blind, lame, and paralyzed. <b class=verse-num id=v43005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. <b class=verse-num id=v43005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you want to be healed?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The sick man answered him, &#8220;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Get up, take up your bed, and walk.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.</p><p id=p43005009_09-1>Now that day was the Sabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v43005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, &#8220;It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But he answered them, &#8220;The man who healed me, that man said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Take up your bed, and walk.&#8217;</span>&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>They asked him, &#8220;Who is the man who said to you, &#8216;Take up your bed and walk&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. <b class=verse-num id=v43005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. <b class=verse-num id=v43005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v43005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My Father is working until now, and I am working.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43005017_09-1>Jesus Is Equal with God</h3><p id=p43005017_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p><h3 id=p43005018_14-1>The Authority of the Son</h3><p id=p43005018_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v43005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing.

Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life.

As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John.

His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I do not receive glory from people.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I know that you do not have the love of God within you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43005043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I have come in my Father&#8217;s name, and you do not receive me.

So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. <b class=verse-num id=v43006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. <b class=verse-num id=v43006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten. <b class=verse-num id=v43006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, &#8220;This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!&#8221;</p><p id=p43006014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p><h3 id=p43006015_06-1>Jesus Walks on Water</h3><p id=p43006015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v43006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. <b class=verse-num id=v43006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. <b class=verse-num id=v43006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened. <b class=verse-num id=v43006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is I; do not be afraid.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</p><h3 id=p43006021_10-1>I Am the Bread of Life</h3><p id=p43006021_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. <b class=verse-num id=v43006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <b class=verse-num id=v43006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</p><p id=p43006024_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, when did you come here?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.

<h3 id=p48002001_01-1>Paul Accepted by the Apostles</h3><p id=p48002001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those who seemed influential) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain. <b class=verse-num id=v48002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v48002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in&#8212;who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. <b class=verse-num id=v48002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)&#8212;those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised <b class=verse-num id=v48002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>(for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), <b class=verse-num id=v48002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v48002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</p><h3 id=p48002010_06-1>Paul Opposes Peter</h3><p id=p48002010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. <b class=verse-num id=v48002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. <b class=verse-num id=v48002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. <b class=verse-num id=v48002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, &#8220;If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p48002014_09-1>Justified by Faith</h3><p id=p48002014_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v48002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; <b class=verse-num id=v48002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.</p><p id=p48002016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! <b class=verse-num id=v48002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. <b class=verse-num id=v48002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. <b class=verse-num id=v48002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.</p></div>

<h3 id=p48003001_01-1>By Faith, or by Works of the Law?</h3><p id=p48003001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. <b class=verse-num id=v48003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? <b class=verse-num id=v48003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? <b class=verse-num id=v48003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Did you suffer so many things in vain&#8212;if indeed it was in vain? <b class=verse-num id=v48003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>just as Abraham &#8220;believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness&#8221;?</p><p id=p48003006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v48003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &#8220;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</p><h3 id=p48003009_09-1>The Righteous Shall Live by Faith</h3><p id=p48003009_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, &#8220;Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for &#8220;The righteous shall live by faith.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the law is not of faith, rather &#8220;The one who does them shall live by them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us&#8212;for it is written, &#8220;Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</p><h3 id=p48003014_15-1>The Law and the Promise</h3><p id=p48003014_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. <b class=verse-num id=v48003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, &#8220;And to offsprings,&#8221; referring to many, but referring to one, &#8220;And to your offspring,&#8221; who is Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. <b class=verse-num id=v48003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</p><p id=p48003018_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. <b class=verse-num id=v48003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.</p><p id=p48003020_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. <b class=verse-num id=v48003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p><p id=p48003022_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. <b class=verse-num id=v48003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. <b class=verse-num id=v48003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, <b class=verse-num id=v48003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. <b class=verse-num id=v48003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v48003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And if you are Christ&#8217;s, then you are Abraham&#8217;s offspring, heirs according to promise.</p></div>

You did me no wrong. <b class=verse-num id=v48004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first, <b class=verse-num id=v48004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v48004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me. <b class=verse-num id=v48004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? <b class=verse-num id=v48004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. <b class=verse-num id=v48004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, <b class=verse-num id=v48004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you! <b class=verse-num id=v48004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</p><h3 id=p48004020_09-1>Example of Hagar and Sarah</h3><p id=p48004020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? <b class=verse-num id=v48004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. <b class=verse-num id=v48004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. <b class=verse-num id=v48004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. <b class=verse-num id=v48004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. <b class=verse-num id=v48004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. <b class=verse-num id=v48004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear;</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor!</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the children of the desolate one will be more</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than those of the one who has a husband.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p48004027_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v48004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <b class=verse-num id=v48004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. <b class=verse-num id=v48004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But what does the Scripture say? &#8220;Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.</p></div>

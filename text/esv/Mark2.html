And he was preaching the word to them. <b class=verse-num id=v41002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. <b class=verse-num id=v41002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. <b class=verse-num id=v41002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span class=woc>&#8220;Son, your sins are forgiven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, <b class=verse-num id=v41002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise, take up your bed and walk&#8217;?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;he said to the paralytic&#8212;<b class=verse-num woc id=v41002011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, &#8220;We never saw anything like this!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p41002012_05-1>Jesus Calls Levi</h3><p id=p41002012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. <b class=verse-num id=v41002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> And he rose and followed him.</p><p id=p41002014_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. <b class=verse-num id=v41002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, &#8220;Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41002017_08-1>A Question About Fasting</h3><p id=p41002017_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now John&#8217;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting.

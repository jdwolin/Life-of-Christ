<h3 id=p09011001_01-1>Saul Defeats the Ammonites</h3><p id=p09011001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Then Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead, and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, &#8220;Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, &#8220;On this condition I will make a treaty with you, that I gouge out all your right eyes, and thus bring disgrace on all Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The elders of Jabesh said to him, &#8220;Give us seven days&#8217; respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported the matter in the ears of the people, and all the people wept aloud.</p><p id=p09011004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now, behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen. And Saul said, &#8220;What is wrong with the people, that they are weeping?&#8221; So they told him the news of the men of Jabesh. <b class=verse-num id=v09011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled. <b class=verse-num id=v09011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, &#8220;Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!&#8221; Then the dread of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out as one man. <b class=verse-num id=v09011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When he mustered them at Bezek, the people of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. <b class=verse-num id=v09011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And they said to the messengers who had come, &#8220;Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: &#8216;Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have salvation.&#8217;&#8221; When the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they were glad. <b class=verse-num id=v09011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, &#8220;Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the next day Saul put the people in three companies. And they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</p><h3 id=p09011011_05-1>The Kingdom Is Renewed</h3><p id=p09011011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v09011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the people said to Samuel, &#8220;Who is it that said, &#8216;Shall Saul reign over us?&#8217; Bring the men, that we may put them to death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Saul said, &#8220;Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said to the people, &#8220;Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</p></div>

I have walked before you from my youth until this day. <b class=verse-num id=v09012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man&#8217;s hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;He is witness.&#8221;</p><p id=p09012005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to the people, &#8220;The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v09012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v09012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When Jacob went into Egypt, and the Egyptians oppressed them, then your fathers cried out to the LORD and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place. <b class=verse-num id=v09012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But they forgot the LORD their God. And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them. <b class=verse-num id=v09012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they cried out to the LORD and said, &#8216;We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety. <b class=verse-num id=v09012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, &#8216;No, but a king shall reign over us,&#8217; when the LORD your God was your king. <b class=verse-num id=v09012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the LORD has set a king over you. <b class=verse-num id=v09012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>If you will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well. <b class=verse-num id=v09012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king. <b class=verse-num id=v09012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v09012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain. And you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</p><p id=p09012018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And all the people said to Samuel, &#8220;Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. <b class=verse-num id=v09012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty. <b class=verse-num id=v09012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For the LORD will not forsake his people, for his great name&#8217;s sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself. <b class=verse-num id=v09012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way. <b class=verse-num id=v09012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you. <b class=verse-num id=v09012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09013001_01-1>Saul Fights the Philistines</h3><p id=p09013001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Saul lived for one year and then became king, and when he had reigned for two years over Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v09013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent. <b class=verse-num id=v09013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, &#8220;Let the Hebrews hear.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.</p><p id=p09013004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven. <b class=verse-num id=v09013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns, <b class=verse-num id=v09013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p><h3 id=p09013007_05-1>Saul&#8217;s Unlawful Sacrifice</h3><p id=p09013007_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him. <b class=verse-num id=v09013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Saul said, &#8220;Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings.&#8221; And he offered the burnt offering. <b class=verse-num id=v09013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and greet him. <b class=verse-num id=v09013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Samuel said, &#8220;What have you done?&#8221; And Saul said, &#8220;When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash, <b class=verse-num id=v09013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>I said, &#8216;Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.&#8217; So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;You have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, with which he commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. <b class=verse-num id=v09013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal. The rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.</p><p id=p09013015_08-1>And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. <b class=verse-num id=v09013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. <b class=verse-num id=v09013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual; <b class=verse-num id=v09013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>another company turned toward Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p><p id=p09013018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, &#8220;Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle, <b class=verse-num id=v09013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads. <b class=verse-num id=v09013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. <b class=verse-num id=v09013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</p></div>

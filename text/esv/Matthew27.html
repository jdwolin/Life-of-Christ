For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40026013_10-1>Judas to Betray Jesus</h3><p id=p40026013_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests <b class=verse-num id=v40026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?&#8221; And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v40026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</p><h3 id=p40026016_14-1>The Passover with the Disciples</h3><p id=p40026016_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, &#8220;Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, &#8216;The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.</p><p id=p40026019_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. <b class=verse-num id=v40026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And as they were eating, he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, &#8220;Is it I, Lord?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Judas, who would betray him, answered, &#8220;Is it I, Rabbi?&#8221; He said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40026025_19-1>Institution of the Lord&#8217;s Supper</h3><p id=p40026025_24-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take, eat; this is my body.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Drink of it, all of you,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&#8217;s kingdom.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40026029_24-1>Jesus Foretells Peter&#8217;s Denial</h3><p id=p40026029_28-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <b class=verse-num id=v40026031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, &#8216;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Peter answered him, &#8220;Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Peter said to him, &#8220;Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!&#8221; And all the disciples said the same.</p><h3 id=p40026035_28-1>Jesus Prays in Gethsemane</h3><p id=p40026035_32-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Sit here, while I go over there and pray.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <b class=verse-num id=v40026038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, <span class=woc>&#8220;So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, <span class=woc>&#8220;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <b class=verse-num id=v40026044-1>44&nbsp;</b>So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. <b class=verse-num id=v40026045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026046-1>46&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40026046_32-1>Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h3><p id=p40026046_37-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026047-1>47&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v40026048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &#8220;The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And he came up to Jesus at once and said, &#8220;Greetings, Rabbi!&#8221; And he kissed him. <b class=verse-num id=v40026050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Friend, do what you came to do.&#8221;</span> Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. <b class=verse-num id=v40026051-1>51&nbsp;</b>And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. <b class=verse-num id=v40026052-1>52&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026053-1>53&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026054-1>54&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026055-1>55&nbsp;</b>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026056-1>56&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p><h3 id=p40026056_37-1>Jesus Before Caiaphas and the Council</h3><p id=p40026056_43-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026057-1>57&nbsp;</b>Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. <b class=verse-num id=v40026058-1>58&nbsp;</b>And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. <b class=verse-num id=v40026059-1>59&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, <b class=verse-num id=v40026060-1>60&nbsp;</b>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward <b class=verse-num id=v40026061-1>61&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;This man said, &#8216;I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026062-1>62&nbsp;</b>And the high priest stood up and said, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026063-1>63&nbsp;</b>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, &#8220;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026064-1>64&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026065-1>65&nbsp;</b>Then the high priest tore his robes and said, &#8220;He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. <b class=verse-num id=v40026066-1>66&nbsp;</b>What is your judgment?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;He deserves death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026067-1>67&nbsp;</b>Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, <b class=verse-num id=v40026068-1>68&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40026068_43-1>Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id=p40026068_46-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026069-1>69&nbsp;</b>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, &#8220;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026070-1>70&nbsp;</b>But he denied it before them all, saying, &#8220;I do not know what you mean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026071-1>71&nbsp;</b>And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, &#8220;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026072-1>72&nbsp;</b>And again he denied it with an oath: &#8220;I do not know the man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026073-1>73&nbsp;</b>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, &#8220;Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026074-1>74&nbsp;</b>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, &#8220;I do not know the man.&#8221; And immediately the rooster crowed. <b class=verse-num id=v40026075-1>75&nbsp;</b>And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, <span class=woc>&#8220;Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> And he went out and wept bitterly.</p></div>

They compelled this man to carry his cross. <b class=verse-num id=v40027033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), <b class=verse-num id=v40027034-1>34&nbsp;</b>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. <b class=verse-num id=v40027035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. <b class=verse-num id=v40027036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. <b class=verse-num id=v40027037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, &#8220;This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. <b class=verse-num id=v40027039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads <b class=verse-num id=v40027040-1>40&nbsp;</b>and saying, &#8220;You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v40027042-1>42&nbsp;</b>&#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <b class=verse-num id=v40027043-1>43&nbsp;</b>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him.

And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. <b class=verse-num id=v40027052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, <b class=verse-num id=v40027053-1>53&nbsp;</b>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. <b class=verse-num id=v40027054-1>54&nbsp;</b>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221;</p><p id=p40027054_30-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027055-1>55&nbsp;</b>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, <b class=verse-num id=v40027056-1>56&nbsp;</b>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p><h3 id=p40027056_30-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p40027056_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027057-1>57&nbsp;</b>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v40027058-1>58&nbsp;</b>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <b class=verse-num id=v40027059-1>59&nbsp;</b>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud <b class=verse-num id=v40027060-1>60&nbsp;</b>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock.

<h3 id=p14025001_01-1>Amaziah Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14025001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14025001-1>25:1&nbsp;</b>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14025002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart. <b class=verse-num id=v14025003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And as soon as the royal power was firmly his, he killed his servants who had struck down the king his father. <b class=verse-num id=v14025004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, &#8220;Fathers shall not die because of their children, nor children die because of their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14025004_05-1>Amaziah&#8217;s Victories</h3><p id=p14025004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers&#8217; houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were 300,000 choice men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield. <b class=verse-num id=v14025006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He hired also 100,000 mighty men of valor from Israel for 100 talents of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v14025007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But a man of God came to him and said, &#8220;O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these Ephraimites. <b class=verse-num id=v14025008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But go, act, be strong for the battle. Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy? For God has power to help or to cast down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Amaziah said to the man of God, &#8220;But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?&#8221; The man of God answered, &#8220;The LORD is able to give you much more than this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger. <b class=verse-num id=v14025011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 men of Seir. <b class=verse-num id=v14025012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The men of Judah captured another 10,000 alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock, and they were all dashed to pieces. <b class=verse-num id=v14025013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 people in them and took much spoil.</p><h3 id=p14025013_07-1>Amaziah&#8217;s Idolatry</h3><p id=p14025013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025014-1>14&nbsp;</b>After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them, making offerings to them. <b class=verse-num id=v14025015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, &#8220;Why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But as he was speaking, the king said to him, &#8220;Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?&#8221; So the prophet stopped, but said, &#8220;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14025016_09-1>Israel Defeats Amaziah</h3><p id=p14025016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Come, let us look one another in the face.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, &#8220;A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son for a wife,&#8217; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. <b class=verse-num id=v14025019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You say, &#8216;See, I have struck down Edom,&#8217; and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?&#8221;</p><p id=p14025019_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom. <b class=verse-num id=v14025021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14025022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home. <b class=verse-num id=v14025023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for 400 cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. <b class=verse-num id=v14025024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, in the care of Obed-edom. He seized also the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria.</p><p id=p14025024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14025026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v14025027-1>27&nbsp;</b>From the time when he turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there. <b class=verse-num id=v14025028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they brought him upon horses, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David.</p></div>

His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. <b class=verse-num id=v14026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.</p><p id=p14026005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v14026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites. <b class=verse-num id=v14026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. <b class=verse-num id=v14026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them. <b class=verse-num id=v14026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he built towers in the wilderness and cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. <b class=verse-num id=v14026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king&#8217;s commanders. <b class=verse-num id=v14026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The whole number of the heads of fathers&#8217; houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600. <b class=verse-num id=v14026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. <b class=verse-num id=v14026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging. <b class=verse-num id=v14026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In Jerusalem he made machines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.</p><h3 id=p14026015_05-1>Uzziah&#8217;s Pride and Punishment</h3><p id=p14026015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. <b class=verse-num id=v14026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor, <b class=verse-num id=v14026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, &#8220;It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense. <b class=verse-num id=v14026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him. <b class=verse-num id=v14026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king&#8217;s household, governing the people of the land.</p><p id=p14026021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote. <b class=verse-num id=v14026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, &#8220;He is a leper.&#8221; And Jotham his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

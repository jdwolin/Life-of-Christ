<h3 id=p27006001_01-1>Daniel and the Lions&#8217; Den</h3><p id=p27006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom; <b class=verse-num id=v27006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss. <b class=verse-num id=v27006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v27006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. <b class=verse-num id=v27006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then these men said, &#8220;We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, &#8220;O King Darius, live forever! <b class=verse-num id=v27006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. <b class=verse-num id=v27006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.</p><p id=p27006009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. <b class=verse-num id=v27006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God. <b class=verse-num id=v27006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, &#8220;O king! Did you not sign an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?&#8221; The king answered and said, &#8220;The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they answered and said before the king, &#8220;Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006013_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him. <b class=verse-num id=v27006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, &#8220;Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared to Daniel, &#8220;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. <b class=verse-num id=v27006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.</p><p id=p27006018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. <b class=verse-num id=v27006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, &#8220;O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel said to the king, &#8220;O king, live forever! <b class=verse-num id=v27006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>My God sent his angel and shut the lions&#8217; mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. <b class=verse-num id=v27006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king commanded, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions&#8212;they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.</p><p id=p27006024_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: &#8220;Peace be multiplied to you. <b class=verse-num id=v27006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p27006026_06-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is the living God,</span><br /><span id=p27006026_06-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enduring forever;</span><br /><span id=p27006026_06-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;his kingdom shall never be destroyed,</span><br /><span id=p27006026_06-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his dominion shall be to the end.</span><br /><span id=p27006027_06-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v27006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;He delivers and rescues;</span><br /><span id=p27006027_06-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he works signs and wonders</span><br /><span id=p27006027_06-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in heaven and on earth,</span><br /><span id=p27006027_06-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;he who has saved Daniel</span><br /><span id=p27006027_06-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the power of the lions.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p27006027_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p></div>

Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v27007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Daniel declared, &#8220;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. <b class=verse-num id=v27007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. <b class=verse-num id=v27007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The first was like a lion and had eagles&#8217; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v27007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &#8216;Arise, devour much flesh.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v27007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v27007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. <b class=verse-num id=v27007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p><h3 id=p27007008_07-1>The Ancient of Days Reigns</h3><p id=p27007008_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v27007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As I looked,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;thrones were placed,</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Ancient of Days took his seat;</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;his clothing was white as snow,</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hair of his head like pure wool;</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;his throne was fiery flames;</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its wheels were burning fire.</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v27007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream of fire issued</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and came out from before him;</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;a thousand thousands served him,</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;the court sat in judgment,</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the books were opened.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p27007010_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v27007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking.

And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal. <b class=verse-num id=v27008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. <b class=verse-num id=v27008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</p><p id=p27008004_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v27008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath. <b class=verse-num id=v27008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. <b class=verse-num id=v27008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.</p><p id=p27008008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. <b class=verse-num id=v27008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. <b class=verse-num id=v27008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. <b class=verse-num id=v27008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper. <b class=verse-num id=v27008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, &#8220;For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;For 2,300 evenings and mornings.

And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face.

But he touched me and made me stand up. <b class=verse-num id=v27008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end. <b class=verse-num id=v27008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. <b class=verse-num id=v27008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king. <b class=verse-num id=v27008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power. <b class=verse-num id=v27008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise. <b class=verse-num id=v27008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>His power shall be great&#8212;but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints. <b class=verse-num id=v27008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken&#8212;but by no human hand. <b class=verse-num id=v27008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.&#8221;</p><p id=p27008026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king&#8217;s business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14010001_01-1>The Revolt Against Rehoboam</h3><p id=p14010001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <b class=verse-num id=v14010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v14010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam, <b class=verse-num id=v14010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Come to me again in three days.&#8221; So the people went away.</p><p id=p14010005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, &#8220;How do you advise me to answer this people?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. <b class=verse-num id=v14010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, &#8216;Lighten the yoke that your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, &#8220;Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, &#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us&#8217;; thus shall you say to them, &#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s thighs. <b class=verse-num id=v14010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p14010011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, &#8220;Come to me again the third day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men, <b class=verse-num id=v14010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, &#8220;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the LORD might fulfill his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p><p id=p14010015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, &#8220;What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.&#8221; So all Israel went to their tents. <b class=verse-num id=v14010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14012001_01-1>Egypt Plunders Jerusalem</h3><p id=p14012001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem <b class=verse-num id=v14012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt&#8212;Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians. <b class=verse-num id=v14012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, &#8220;The LORD is righteous.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: &#8220;They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. <b class=verse-num id=v14012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.&#8221;</p><p id=p14012008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house. He took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made, <b class=verse-num id=v14012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v14012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom. <b class=verse-num id=v14012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, conditions were good in Judah.</p><p id=p14012012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite. <b class=verse-num id=v14012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.</p><p id=p14012014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer? There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. <b class=verse-num id=v14012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

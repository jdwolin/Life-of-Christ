We have no vineyard or field or seed, <b class=verse-num id=v24035010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us. <b class=verse-num id=v24035011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, &#8216;Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.&#8217; So we are living in Jerusalem.&#8221;</p><p id=p24035011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24035012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <b class=verse-num id=v24035013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v24035014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father&#8217;s command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me. <b class=verse-num id=v24035015-1>15&nbsp;</b>I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, &#8216;Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.&#8217; But you did not incline your ear or listen to me. <b class=verse-num id=v24035016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me. <b class=verse-num id=v24035017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered.&#8221;</p><p id=p24035017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24035018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you, <b class=verse-num id=v24035019-1>19&nbsp;</b>therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me.&#8221;</p></div>

And they said to Baruch, &#8220;We must report all these words to the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then they asked Baruch, &#8220;Tell us, please, how did you write all these words?

And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king. <b class=verse-num id=v24036022-1>22&nbsp;</b>It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him. <b class=verse-num id=v24036023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot. <b class=verse-num id=v24036024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v24036025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king&#8217;s son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.</p><p id=p24036026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <b class=verse-num id=v24036028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. <b class=verse-num id=v24036029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, &#8220;Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night. <b class=verse-num id=v24036031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p24036031_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.</p></div>

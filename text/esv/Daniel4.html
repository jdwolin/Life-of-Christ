<h3 id=p27003001_01-1>Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s Golden Image</h3><p id=p27003001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v27003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <b class=verse-num id=v27003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <b class=verse-num id=v27003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the herald proclaimed aloud, &#8220;You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, <b class=verse-num id=v27003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. <b class=verse-num id=v27003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p><h3 id=p27003007_04-1>The Fiery Furnace</h3><p id=p27003007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v27003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>They declared to King Nebuchadnezzar, &#8220;O king, live forever! <b class=verse-num id=v27003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image. <b class=verse-num id=v27003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace. <b class=verse-num id=v27003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.&#8221;</p><p id=p27003012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v27003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, &#8220;Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up? <b class=verse-num id=v27003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?&#8221;</p><p id=p27003015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. <b class=verse-num id=v27003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. <b class=verse-num id=v27003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.&#8221;</p><p id=p27003018_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated. <b class=verse-num id=v27003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <b class=verse-num id=v27003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace. <b class=verse-num id=v27003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Because the king&#8217;s order was urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. <b class=verse-num id=v27003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.</p><p id=p27003023_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He declared to his counselors, &#8220;Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?&#8221; They answered and said to the king, &#8220;True, O king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He answered and said, &#8220;But I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.&#8221;</p><p id=p27003025_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, &#8220;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!&#8221; Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire. <b class=verse-num id=v27003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king&#8217;s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v27003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, &#8220;Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside the king&#8217;s command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. <b class=verse-num id=v27003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27003030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</p></div>

As I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me. <b class=verse-num id=v27004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. <b class=verse-num id=v27004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>At last Daniel came in before me&#8212;he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods&#8212;and I told him the dream, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v27004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too difficult for you, tell me the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. <b class=verse-num id=v27004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth. <b class=verse-num id=v27004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all.

He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles&#8217; feathers, and his nails were like birds&#8217; claws.</p><h3 id=p27004033_14-1>Nebuchadnezzar Restored</h3><p id=p27004033_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v27004034-1>34&nbsp;</b>At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p27004034_16-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,</span><br /><span id=p27004034_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v27004035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he does according to his will among the host of heaven</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and among the inhabitants of the earth;</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and none can stay his hand</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or say to him, &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p27004035_16-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v27004036-1>36&nbsp;</b>At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me.

And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.</p><p id=p27005023_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed. <b class=verse-num id=v27005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN. <b class=verse-num id=v27005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; <b class=verse-num id=v27005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; <b class=verse-num id=v27005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.&#8221;</p><p id=p27005028_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p><p id=p27005029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed. <b class=verse-num id=v27005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.</p></div>

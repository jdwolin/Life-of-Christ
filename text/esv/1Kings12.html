<h3 id=p11011001_01-1>Solomon Turns from the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span></h3><p id=p11011001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, <b class=verse-num id=v11011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, &#8220;You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.&#8221; Solomon clung to these in love. <b class=verse-num id=v11011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. <b class=verse-num id=v11011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. <b class=verse-num id=v11011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v11011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done. <b class=verse-num id=v11011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.</p><h3 id=p11011008_06-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Raises Adversaries</h3><p id=p11011008_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice <b class=verse-num id=v11011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the LORD commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v11011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, &#8220;Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v11011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. <b class=verse-num id=v11011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen.&#8221;</p><p id=p11011013_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal house in Edom. <b class=verse-num id=v11011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom <b class=verse-num id=v11011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom). <b class=verse-num id=v11011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father&#8217;s servants, Hadad still being a little child. <b class=verse-num id=v11011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land. <b class=verse-num id=v11011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. <b class=verse-num id=v11011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh&#8217;s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh&#8217;s house among the sons of Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v11011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Pharaoh said to him, &#8220;What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Only let me depart.&#8221;</p><p id=p11011022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah. <b class=verse-num id=v11011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v11011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria.</p><p id=p11011025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother&#8217;s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. <b class=verse-num id=v11011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father. <b class=verse-num id=v11011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v11011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country. <b class=verse-num id=v11011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. <b class=verse-num id=v11011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said to Jeroboam, &#8220;Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes <b class=verse-num id=v11011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), <b class=verse-num id=v11011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did. <b class=verse-num id=v11011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes. <b class=verse-num id=v11011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But I will take the kingdom out of his son&#8217;s hand and will give it to you, ten tribes. <b class=verse-num id=v11011036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name. <b class=verse-num id=v11011037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v11011038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. <b class=verse-num id=v11011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11011040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p><p id=p11011040_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? <b class=verse-num id=v11011042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v11011043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Go away for three days, then come again to me.&#8221; So the people went away.</p><p id=p11012005_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v11012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, &#8220;How do you advise me to answer this people?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, &#8216;Lighten the yoke that your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, &#8220;Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, &#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,&#8217; thus shall you say to them, &#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s thighs. <b class=verse-num id=v11012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p11012011_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v11012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, &#8220;Come to me again the third day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him, <b class=verse-num id=v11012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, &#8220;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p><h3 id=p11012015_03-1>The Kingdom Divided</h3><p id=p11012015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v11012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, &#8220;What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.&#8221; So Israel went to their tents. <b class=verse-num id=v11012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v11012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v11012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only.</p><p id=p11012020_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v11012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <b class=verse-num id=v11012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: <b class=verse-num id=v11012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, <b class=verse-num id=v11012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel. Every man return to his home, for this thing is from me.&#8217;&#8221; So they listened to the word of the LORD and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.</p><h3 id=p11012024_06-1>Jeroboam&#8217;s Golden Calves</h3><p id=p11012024_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel. <b class=verse-num id=v11012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Jeroboam said in his heart, &#8220;Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David. <b class=verse-num id=v11012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, &#8220;You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. <b class=verse-num id=v11012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to be before one. <b class=verse-num id=v11012031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He also made temples on high places and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites. <b class=verse-num id=v11012032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. <b class=verse-num id=v11012033-1>33&nbsp;</b>He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar to make offerings.</p></div>

Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v11013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the man cried against the altar by the word of the LORD and said, &#8220;O altar, altar, thus says the LORD: &#8216;Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, &#8220;This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: &#8216;Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, &#8220;Seize him.&#8221; And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself. <b class=verse-num id=v11013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v11013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.&#8221; And the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king&#8217;s hand was restored to him and became as it was before. <b class=verse-num id=v11013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the man of God said to the king, &#8220;If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you.

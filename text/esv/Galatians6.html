<h3 id=p48005001_01-1>Christ Has Set Us Free</h3><p id=p48005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p><p id=p48005001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. <b class=verse-num id=v48005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. <b class=verse-num id=v48005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v48005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.</p><p id=p48005006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? <b class=verse-num id=v48005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>This persuasion is not from him who calls you. <b class=verse-num id=v48005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. <b class=verse-num id=v48005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. <b class=verse-num id=v48005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. <b class=verse-num id=v48005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!</p><p id=p48005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. <b class=verse-num id=v48005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</p><h3 id=p48005015_06-1>Keep in Step with the Spirit</h3><p id=p48005015_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v48005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. <b class=verse-num id=v48005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, <b class=verse-num id=v48005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, <b class=verse-num id=v48005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v48005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <b class=verse-num id=v48005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</p><p id=p48005024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v48005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</p></div>

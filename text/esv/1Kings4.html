<h3 id=p11003001_01-1>Solomon&#8217;s Prayer for Wisdom</h3><p id=p11003001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.</p><p id=p11003002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places. <b class=verse-num id=v11003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. <b class=verse-num id=v11003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, &#8220;Ask what I shall give you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Solomon said, &#8220;You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day. <b class=verse-num id=v11003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in. <b class=verse-num id=v11003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v11003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?&#8221;</p><p id=p11003009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. <b class=verse-num id=v11003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God said to him, &#8220;Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, <b class=verse-num id=v11003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. <b class=verse-num id=v11003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. <b class=verse-num id=v11003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.&#8221;</p><p id=p11003014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</p><h3 id=p11003015_05-1>Solomon&#8217;s Wisdom</h3><p id=p11003015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The one woman said, &#8220;Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. <b class=verse-num id=v11003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were alone. There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house. <b class=verse-num id=v11003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And this woman&#8217;s son died in the night, because she lay on him. <b class=verse-num id=v11003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast. <b class=verse-num id=v11003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the child that I had borne.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the other woman said, &#8220;No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours.&#8221; The first said, &#8220;No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine.&#8221; Thus they spoke before the king.</p><p id=p11003022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the king said, &#8220;The one says, &#8216;This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead&#8217;; and the other says, &#8216;No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Bring me a sword.&#8221; So a sword was brought before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v11003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because her heart yearned for her son, &#8220;Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means put him to death.&#8221; But the other said, &#8220;He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the king answered and said, &#8220;Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means put him to death; she is his mother.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.</p></div>

<h3 id=p11005001_01-1>Preparations for Building the Temple</h3><p id=p11005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. <b class=verse-num id=v11005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Solomon sent word to Hiram, <b class=verse-num id=v11005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. <b class=verse-num id=v11005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune. <b class=verse-num id=v11005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, &#8216;Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.&#8221;</p><p id=p11005006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v11005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, &#8220;I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. <b class=verse-num id=v11005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, <b class=verse-num id=v11005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. <b class=verse-num id=v11005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.</p><p id=p11005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v11005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men. <b class=verse-num id=v11005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft. <b class=verse-num id=v11005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, <b class=verse-num id=v11005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>besides Solomon&#8217;s 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. <b class=verse-num id=v11005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>At the king&#8217;s command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. <b class=verse-num id=v11005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So Solomon&#8217;s builders and Hiram&#8217;s builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.</p></div>

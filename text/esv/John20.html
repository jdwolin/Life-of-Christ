<h3 id=p43019001_01-1>Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified</h3><p id=p43019001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. <b class=verse-num id=v43019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe. <b class=verse-num id=v43019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>They came up to him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; and struck him with their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v43019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Pilate went out again and said to them, &#8220;See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &#8220;Behold the man!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, &#8220;Crucify him, crucify him!&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The Jews answered him, &#8220;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v43019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; But Jesus gave him no answer. <b class=verse-num id=v43019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Pilate said to him, &#8220;You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43019011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, &#8220;If you release this man, you are not Caesar&#8217;s friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. <b class=verse-num id=v43019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, &#8220;Behold your King!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They cried out, &#8220;Away with him, away with him, crucify him!&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Shall I crucify your King?&#8221; The chief priests answered, &#8220;We have no king but Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.</p><h3 id=p43019016_06-1>The Crucifixion</h3><p id=p43019016_08-1>So they took Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v43019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. <b class=verse-num id=v43019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. <b class=verse-num id=v43019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v43019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &#8220;Do not write, &#8216;The King of the Jews,&#8217; but rather, &#8216;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Pilate answered, &#8220;What I have written I have written.&#8221;</p><p id=p43019022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, <b class=verse-num id=v43019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>so they said to one another, &#8220;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&#8221; This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p43019024_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;They divided my garments among them,</span><br /><span id=p43019024_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for my clothing they cast lots.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p43019024_08-1 class=same-paragraph>So the soldiers did these things, <b class=verse-num id=v43019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother&#8217;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <b class=verse-num id=v43019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, behold, your son!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then he said to the disciple, <span class=woc>&#8220;Behold, your mother!&#8221;</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p><h3 id=p43019027_08-1>The Death of Jesus</h3><p id=p43019027_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class=woc>&#8220;I thirst.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v43019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is finished,&#8221;</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p><h3 id=p43019030_12-1>Jesus&#8217; Side Is Pierced</h3><p id=p43019030_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. <b class=verse-num id=v43019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. <b class=verse-num id=v43019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <b class=verse-num id=v43019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. <b class=verse-num id=v43019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>He who saw it has borne witness&#8212;his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth&#8212;that you also may believe. <b class=verse-num id=v43019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: &#8220;Not one of his bones will be broken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And again another Scripture says, &#8220;They will look on him whom they have pierced.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43019037_16-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p43019037_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. <b class=verse-num id=v43019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. <b class=verse-num id=v43019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v43019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. <b class=verse-num id=v43019042-1>42&nbsp;</b>So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p></div>

He saw the linen cloths lying there, <b class=verse-num id=v43020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus&#8217; head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. <b class=verse-num id=v43020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; <b class=verse-num id=v43020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v43020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples went back to their homes.</p><h3 id=p43020010_03-1>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</h3><p id=p43020010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v43020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. <b class=verse-num id=v43020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. <b class=verse-num id=v43020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>They said to her, &#8220;Woman, why are you weeping?&#8221; She said to them, &#8220;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v43020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&#8221;</span> Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &#8220;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Mary.&#8221;</span> She turned and said to him in Aramaic, &#8220;Rabboni!&#8221; (which means Teacher). <b class=verse-num id=v43020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, &#8216;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &#8220;I have seen the Lord&#8221;&#8212;and that he had said these things to her.</p><h3 id=p43020018_08-1>Jesus Appears to the Disciples</h3><p id=p43020018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v43020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.

And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.</p><p id=p24037005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v24037006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet: <b class=verse-num id=v24037007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, &#8216;Behold, Pharaoh&#8217;s army that came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land. <b class=verse-num id=v24037008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. They shall capture it and burn it with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v24037009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, &#8220;The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,&#8221; for they will not go away. <b class=verse-num id=v24037010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3 id=p24037010_04-1>Jeremiah Imprisoned</h3><p id=p24037010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24037011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh&#8217;s army, <b class=verse-num id=v24037012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people. <b class=verse-num id=v24037013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, &#8220;You are deserting to the Chaldeans.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24037014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Jeremiah said, &#8220;It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.&#8221; But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. <b class=verse-num id=v24037015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.</p><p id=p24037015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24037016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days, <b class=verse-num id=v24037017-1>17&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, &#8220;Is there any word from the LORD?&#8221; Jeremiah said, &#8220;There is.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24037018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, &#8220;What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison? <b class=verse-num id=v24037019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, &#8216;The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land&#8217;? <b class=verse-num id=v24037020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24037021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers&#8217; street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p></div>

He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live. <b class=verse-num id=v24038003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the officials said to the king, &#8220;Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038005-1>5&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah said, &#8220;Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king&#8217;s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.</p><h3 id=p24038006_06-1>Jeremiah Rescued from the Cistern</h3><p id=p24038006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king&#8217;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern&#8212;the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v24038008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Ebed-melech went from the king&#8217;s house and said to the king, <b class=verse-num id=v24038009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, &#8220;Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes. <b class=verse-num id=v24038012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, &#8220;Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.&#8221; Jeremiah did so. <b class=verse-num id=v24038013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p><h3 id=p24038013_11-1>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again</h3><p id=p24038013_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038014-1>14&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, &#8220;I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &#8220;If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, &#8220;As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life.&#8221;</p><p id=p24038016_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. <b class=verse-num id=v24038018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038019-1>19&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &#8220;I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah said, &#8220;You shall not be given to them.

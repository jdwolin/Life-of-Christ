<h3 id=p26013001_01-1>False Prophets Condemned</h3><p id=p26013001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, and say to those who prophesy from their own hearts: &#8216;Hear the word of the LORD!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! <b class=verse-num id=v26013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, &#8216;Declares the LORD,&#8217; when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word. <b class=verse-num id=v26013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, &#8216;Declares the LORD,&#8217; although I have not spoken?&#8221;</p><p id=p26013007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, &#8216;Peace,&#8217; when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash, <b class=verse-num id=v26013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out. <b class=verse-num id=v26013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, &#8216;Where is the coating with which you smeared it?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end. <b class=verse-num id=v26013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it, <b class=verse-num id=v26013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26013016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them <b class=verse-num id=v26013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive? <b class=verse-num id=v26013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.</p><p id=p26013019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds. <b class=verse-num id=v26013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life, <b class=verse-num id=v26013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them? <b class=verse-num id=v26014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols, <b class=verse-num id=v26014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.</p><p id=p26014005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the LORD will answer him myself. <b class=verse-num id=v26014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they shall bear their punishment&#8212;the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v26014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26014011_04-1>Jerusalem Will Not Be Spared</h3><p id=p26014011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast, <b class=verse-num id=v26014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26014014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts, <b class=verse-num id=v26014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>even if these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters.

<h3 id=p10018001_01-1>Absalom Killed</h3><p id=p10018001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. <b class=verse-num id=v10018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, &#8220;I myself will also go out with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the men said, &#8220;You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The king said to them, &#8220;Whatever seems best to you I will do.&#8221; So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. <b class=verse-num id=v10018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, &#8220;Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.&#8221; And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.</p><p id=p10018005_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. <b class=verse-num id=v10018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men. <b class=verse-num id=v10018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.</p><p id=p10018008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on. <b class=verse-num id=v10018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And a certain man saw it and told Joab, &#8220;Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Joab said to the man who told him, &#8220;What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the man said to Joab, &#8220;Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king&#8217;s son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, &#8216;For my sake protect the young man Absalom.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Joab said, &#8220;I will not waste time like this with you.&#8221; And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak. <b class=verse-num id=v10018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And ten young men, Joab&#8217;s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.</p><p id=p10018015_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them. <b class=verse-num id=v10018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home. <b class=verse-num id=v10018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King&#8217;s Valley, for he said, &#8220;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.&#8221; He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom&#8217;s monument to this day.</p><h3 id=p10018018_03-1>David Hears of Absalom&#8217;s Death</h3><p id=p10018018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, &#8220;Let me run and carry news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Joab said to him, &#8220;You are not to carry news today. You may carry news another day, but today you shall carry no news, because the king&#8217;s son is dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Joab said to the Cushite, &#8220;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&#8221; The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran. <b class=verse-num id=v10018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, &#8220;Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite.&#8221; And Joab said, &#8220;Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Come what may,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will run.&#8221; So he said to him, &#8220;Run.&#8221; Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.</p><p id=p10018023_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone. <b class=verse-num id=v10018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, &#8220;If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.&#8221; And he drew nearer and nearer. <b class=verse-num id=v10018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gate and said, &#8220;See, another man running alone!&#8221; The king said, &#8220;He also brings news.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The watchman said, &#8220;I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.&#8221; And the king said, &#8220;He is a good man and comes with good news.&#8221;</p><p id=p10018027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, &#8220;All is well.&#8221; And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Is it well with the young man Absalom?&#8221; Ahimaaz answered, &#8220;When Joab sent the king&#8217;s servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what it was.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Turn aside and stand here.&#8221; So he turned aside and stood still.</p><h3 id=p10018030_08-1>David&#8217;s Grief</h3><p id=p10018030_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And behold, the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, &#8220;Good news for my lord the king! For the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The king said to the Cushite, &#8220;Is it well with the young man Absalom?&#8221; And the Cushite answered, &#8220;May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, he said, &#8220;O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p10019001_01-1>Joab Rebukes David</h3><p id=p10019001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>It was told Joab, &#8220;Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard that day, &#8220;The king is grieving for his son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the people stole into the city that day as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle. <b class=verse-num id=v10019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, &#8220;O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, &#8220;You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who have this day saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and your concubines, <b class=verse-num id=v10019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>because you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you, for today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased. <b class=verse-num id=v10019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the king arose and took his seat in the gate. And the people were all told, &#8220;Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.&#8221; And all the people came before the king.</p><h3 id=p10019008_04-1>David Returns to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10019008_08-1>Now Israel had fled every man to his own home. <b class=verse-num id=v10019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And all the people were arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &#8220;The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. <b class=verse-num id=v10019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?&#8221;</p><p id=p10019010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: &#8220;Say to the elders of Judah, &#8216;Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king? <b class=verse-num id=v10019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And say to Amasa, &#8216;Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if you are not commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he swayed the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent word to the king, &#8220;Return, both you and all your servants.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So the king came back to the Jordan, and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan.</p><h3 id=p10019015_08-1>David Pardons His Enemies</h3><p id=p10019015_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David. <b class=verse-num id=v10019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And with him were a thousand men from Benjamin. And Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan before the king, <b class=verse-num id=v10019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and they crossed the ford to bring over the king&#8217;s household and to do his pleasure. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan, <b class=verse-num id=v10019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and said to the king, &#8220;Let not my lord hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Do not let the king take it to heart. <b class=verse-num id=v10019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, &#8220;Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD&#8217;s anointed?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But David said, &#8220;What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be as an adversary to me? Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the king said to Shimei, &#8220;You shall not die.&#8221; And the king gave him his oath.</p><p id=p10019023_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. He had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety. <b class=verse-num id=v10019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, &#8220;Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;My lord, O king, my servant deceived me, for your servant said to him, &#8216;I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go with the king.&#8217; For your servant is lame. <b class=verse-num id=v10019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you. <b class=verse-num id=v10019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For all my father&#8217;s house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the king said to him, &#8220;Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Mephibosheth said to the king, &#8220;Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home.&#8221;</p><p id=p10019030_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v10019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. <b class=verse-num id=v10019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the king said to Barzillai, &#8220;Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But Barzillai said to the king, &#8220;How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? <b class=verse-num id=v10019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? <b class=verse-num id=v10019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward? <b class=verse-num id=v10019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do for him whatever seems good to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And the king answered, &#8220;Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home. <b class=verse-num id=v10019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.</p><p id=p10019040_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, &#8220;Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David&#8217;s men with him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019042-1>42&nbsp;</b>All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, &#8220;Because the king is our close relative. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king&#8217;s expense? Or has he given us any gift?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, &#8220;We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?&#8221; But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</p></div>

But the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p10020002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house and put them in a house under guard and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.</p><p id=p10020003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Amasa, &#8220;Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him. <b class=verse-num id=v10020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abishai, &#8220;Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord&#8217;s servants and pursue him, lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And there went out after him Joab&#8217;s men and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men.

And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field and threw a garment over him. <b class=verse-num id=v10020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.</p><p id=p10020013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah, and all the Bichrites assembled and followed him in. <b class=verse-num id=v10020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah. They cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart, and they were battering the wall to throw it down. <b class=verse-num id=v10020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then a wise woman called from the city, &#8220;Listen! Listen! Tell Joab, &#8216;Come here, that I may speak to you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he came near her, and the woman said, &#8220;Are you Joab?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am.&#8221; Then she said to him, &#8220;Listen to the words of your servant.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;I am listening.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then she said, &#8220;They used to say in former times, &#8216;Let them but ask counsel at Abel,&#8217; and so they settled a matter. <b class=verse-num id=v10020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the heritage of the LORD?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Joab answered, &#8220;Far be it from me, far be it, that I should swallow up or destroy! <b class=verse-num id=v10020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David. Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city.&#8221; And the woman said to Joab, &#8220;Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</p><p id=p10020022_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites; <b class=verse-num id=v10020024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; <b class=verse-num id=v10020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and Sheva was secretary; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; <b class=verse-num id=v10020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and Ira the Jairite was also David&#8217;s priest.</p></div>

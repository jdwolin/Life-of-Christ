<h3 id=p01047001_01-1>Jacob&#8217;s Family Settles in Goshen</h3><p id=p01047001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01047001-1>47:1&nbsp;</b>So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, &#8220;My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v01047003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Pharaoh said to his brothers, &#8220;What is your occupation?&#8221; And they said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They said to Pharaoh, &#8220;We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants&#8217; flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Your father and your brothers have come to you. <b class=verse-num id=v01047006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.&#8221;</p><p id=p01047006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v01047008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, &#8220;How many are the days of the years of your life?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, &#8220;The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v01047011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v01047012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father&#8217;s household with food, according to the number of their dependents.</p><h3 id=p01047012_06-1>Joseph and the Famine</h3><p id=p01047012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. <b class=verse-num id=v01047014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01047015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, &#8220;Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Joseph answered, &#8220;Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. <b class=verse-num id=v01047018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, &#8220;We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord&#8217;s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land. <b class=verse-num id=v01047019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.&#8221;</p><p id=p01047019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v01047021-1>21&nbsp;</b>As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other. <b class=verse-num id=v01047022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.</p><p id=p01047022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to the people, &#8220;Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01047024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh&#8217;s.</p><p id=p01047026_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. <b class=verse-num id=v01047028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.</p><p id=p01047028_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v01047030-1>30&nbsp;</b>but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I will do as you have said.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Swear to me&#8221;; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.</p></div>

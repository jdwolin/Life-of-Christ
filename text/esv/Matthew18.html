<h3 id=p40017001_01-1>The Transfiguration</h3><p id=p40017001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v40017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v40017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. <b class=verse-num id=v40017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. <b class=verse-num id=v40017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. <b class=verse-num id=v40017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise, and have no fear.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p><p id=p40017008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the disciples asked him, &#8220;Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p><h3 id=p40017013_03-1>Jesus Heals a Boy with a Demon</h3><p id=p40017013_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him, <b class=verse-num id=v40017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>said, &#8220;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. <b class=verse-num id=v40017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly. <b class=verse-num id=v40017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &#8216;Move from here to there,&#8217; and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40017020_10-1>Jesus Again Foretells Death, Resurrection</h3><p id=p40017020_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.&#8221;</span> And they were greatly distressed.</p><h3 id=p40017023_15-1>The Temple Tax</h3><p id=p40017023_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went up to Peter and said, &#8220;Does your teacher not pay the tax?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he said, &#8220;From others,&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Then the sons are free.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.&#8221;</span></p></div>

For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40018008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40018009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.</span></p><h3 id=p40018009_08-1>The Parable of the Lost Sheep</h3><p id=p40018009_14-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40018010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;See that you do not despise one of these little ones.

What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p40019009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, &#8220;If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40019012_04-1>Let the Children Come to Me</h3><p id=p40019012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, <b class=verse-num id=v40019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he laid his hands on them and went away.</p><h3 id=p40019015_10-1>The Rich Young Man</h3><p id=p40019015_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v40019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And behold, a man came up to him, saying, &#8220;Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He said to him, &#8220;Which ones?&#8221; And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40019019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The young man said to him, &#8220;All these I have kept.

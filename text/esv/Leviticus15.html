He shall be brought to the priest, <b class=verse-num id=v03014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall look. Then, if the case of leprous disease is healed in the leprous person, <b class=verse-num id=v03014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two live clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet yarn and hyssop. <b class=verse-num id=v03014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthenware vessel over fresh water. <b class=verse-num id=v03014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He shall take the live bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet yarn and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the fresh water. <b class=verse-num id=v03014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is to be cleansed of the leprous disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird go into the open field. <b class=verse-num id=v03014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after that he may come into the camp, but live outside his tent seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v03014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And on the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair from his head, his beard, and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair, and then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.</p><p id=p03014009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v03014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and one log of oil. <b class=verse-num id=v03014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed and these things before the LORD, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <b class=verse-num id=v03014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it for a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v03014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary.

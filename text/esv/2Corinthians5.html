<h3 id=p47004001_01-1>The Light of the Gospel</h3><p id=p47004001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. <b class=verse-num id=v47004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God&#8217;s word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone&#8217;s conscience in the sight of God. <b class=verse-num id=v47004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. <b class=verse-num id=v47004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. <b class=verse-num id=v47004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&#8217; sake. <b class=verse-num id=v47004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For God, who said, &#8220;Let light shine out of darkness,&#8221; has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p><h3 id=p47004006_06-1>Treasure in Jars of Clay</h3><p id=p47004006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. <b class=verse-num id=v47004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; <b class=verse-num id=v47004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; <b class=verse-num id=v47004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. <b class=verse-num id=v47004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus&#8217; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v47004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So death is at work in us, but life in you.</p><p id=p47004012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, &#8220;I believed, and so I spoke,&#8221; we also believe, and so we also speak, <b class=verse-num id=v47004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. <b class=verse-num id=v47004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p><p id=p47004015_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. <b class=verse-num id=v47004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, <b class=verse-num id=v47004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</p></div>

We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, <b class=verse-num id=v47005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>for we walk by faith, not by sight. <b class=verse-num id=v47005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v47005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. <b class=verse-num id=v47005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.</p><h3 id=p47005010_04-1>The Ministry of Reconciliation</h3><p id=p47005010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v47005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v47005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. <b class=verse-num id=v47005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. <b class=verse-num id=v47005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; <b class=verse-num id=v47005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</p><p id=p47005015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v47005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. <b class=verse-num id=v47005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. <b class=verse-num id=v47005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; <b class=verse-num id=v47005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. <b class=verse-num id=v47005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. <b class=verse-num id=v47005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p></div>

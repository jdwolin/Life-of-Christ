<h3 id=p10005001_01-1>David Anointed King of Israel</h3><p id=p10005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, &#8220;Behold, we are your bone and flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v10005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD said to you, &#8216;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v10005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</p><p id=p10005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, &#8220;You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off&#8221;&#8212;thinking, &#8220;David cannot come in here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. <b class=verse-num id=v10005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David said on that day, &#8220;Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack &#8216;the lame and the blind,&#8217; who are hated by David&#8217;s soul.&#8221; Therefore it is said, &#8220;The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward. <b class=verse-num id=v10005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.</p><p id=p10005010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house. <b class=verse-num id=v10005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David knew that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p><p id=p10005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David. <b class=verse-num id=v10005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <b class=verse-num id=v10005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, <b class=verse-num id=v10005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p><h3 id=p10005016_06-1>David Defeats the Philistines</h3><p id=p10005016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold. <b class=verse-num id=v10005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And David inquired of the LORD, &#8220;Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?&#8221; And the LORD said to David, &#8220;Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. And he said, &#8220;The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a breaking flood.&#8221; Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim. <b class=verse-num id=v10005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.</p><p id=p10005021_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines came up yet again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, &#8220;You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come against them opposite the balsam trees. <b class=verse-num id=v10005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then rouse yourself, for then the LORD has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And David did as the LORD commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10006001_01-1>The Ark Brought to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. <b class=verse-num id=v10006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who sits enthroned on the cherubim. <b class=verse-num id=v10006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart, <b class=verse-num id=v10006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.</p><h3 id=p10006004_06-1>Uzzah and the Ark</h3><p id=p10006004_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals. <b class=verse-num id=v10006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. <b class=verse-num id=v10006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God. <b class=verse-num id=v10006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v10006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, &#8220;How can the ark of the LORD come to me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So David was not willing to take the ark of the LORD into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. <b class=verse-num id=v10006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.</p><p id=p10006011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And it was told King David, &#8220;The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.&#8221; So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing. <b class=verse-num id=v10006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal. <b class=verse-num id=v10006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v10006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn.</p><h3 id=p10006015_10-1>David and Michal</h3><p id=p10006015_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart. <b class=verse-num id=v10006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v10006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts <b class=verse-num id=v10006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to each one.

But by the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</p></div>

The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. <b class=verse-num id=v01025004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. <b class=verse-num id=v01025005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v01025006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.</p><p id=p01025006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01025007-1>7&nbsp;</b>These are the days of the years of Abraham&#8217;s life, 175 years. <b class=verse-num id=v01025008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people. <b class=verse-num id=v01025009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre, <b class=verse-num id=v01025010-1>10&nbsp;</b>the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01025011-1>11&nbsp;</b>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi.</p><p id=p01025011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01025012-1>12&nbsp;</b>These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham&#8217;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&#8217;s servant, bore to Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v01025013-1>13&nbsp;</b>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, <b class=verse-num id=v01025014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Mishma, Dumah, Massa, <b class=verse-num id=v01025015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. <b class=verse-num id=v01025016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes. <b class=verse-num id=v01025017-1>17&nbsp;</b>(These are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.) <b class=verse-num id=v01025018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria.

And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. <b class=verse-num id=v01025022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The children struggled together within her, and she said, &#8220;If it is thus, why is this happening to me?&#8221; So she went to inquire of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01025023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to her,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p01025023_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Two nations are in your womb,</span><br /><span id=p01025023_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two peoples from within you shall be divided;</span><br /><span id=p01025023_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;the one shall be stronger than the other,</span><br /><span id=p01025023_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the older shall serve the younger.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p01025023_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v01025024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. <b class=verse-num id=v01025025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau. <b class=verse-num id=v01025026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau&#8217;s heel, so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p><p id=p01025026_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v01025027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. <b class=verse-num id=v01025028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p><h3 id=p01025028_12-1>Esau Sells His Birthright</h3><p id=p01025028_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v01025029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted. <b class=verse-num id=v01025030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Esau said to Jacob, &#8220;Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!&#8221; (Therefore his name was called Edom.) <b class=verse-num id=v01025031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, &#8220;Sell me your birthright now.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01025032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Esau said, &#8220;I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01025033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, &#8220;Swear to me now.&#8221; So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. <b class=verse-num id=v01025034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</p></div>

And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v01026002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared to him and said, &#8220;Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. <b class=verse-num id=v01026003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father. <b class=verse-num id=v01026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, <b class=verse-num id=v01026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01026005_05-1>Isaac and Abimelech</h3><p id=p01026005_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Isaac settled in Gerar. <b class=verse-num id=v01026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, &#8220;She is my sister,&#8221; for he feared to say, &#8220;My wife,&#8221; thinking, &#8220;lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,&#8221; because she was attractive in appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v01026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech called Isaac and said, &#8220;Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;?&#8221; Isaac said to him, &#8220;Because I thought, &#8216;Lest I die because of her.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Abimelech said, &#8220;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, &#8220;Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&#8221;</p><p id=p01026011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD blessed him, <b class=verse-num id=v01026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy. <b class=verse-num id=v01026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him. <b class=verse-num id=v01026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>(Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells that his father&#8217;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.) <b class=verse-num id=v01026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Isaac, &#8220;Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.&#8221;</p><p id=p01026016_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. <b class=verse-num id=v01026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And he gave them the names that his father had given them. <b class=verse-num id=v01026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But when Isaac&#8217;s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water, <b class=verse-num id=v01026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac&#8217;s herdsmen, saying, &#8220;The water is ours.&#8221; So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah. <b class=verse-num id=v01026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, &#8220;For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.&#8221;</p><p id=p01026022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>From there he went up to Beersheba. <b class=verse-num id=v01026024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, &#8220;I am the God of Abraham your father. Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham&#8217;s sake.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac&#8217;s servants dug a well.</p><p id=p01026025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army, <b class=verse-num id=v01026027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Isaac said to them, &#8220;Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026028-1>28&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you, <b class=verse-num id=v01026029-1>29&nbsp;</b>that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. <b class=verse-num id=v01026031-1>31&nbsp;</b>In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace. <b class=verse-num id=v01026032-1>32&nbsp;</b>That same day Isaac&#8217;s servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, &#8220;We have found water.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01026033-1>33&nbsp;</b>He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.</p><p id=p01026033_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01026034-1>34&nbsp;</b>When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <b class=verse-num id=v01026035-1>35&nbsp;</b>and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.</p></div>

So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, <b class=verse-num id=v01027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &#8220;I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, <b class=verse-num id=v01027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. <b class=verse-num id=v01027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. <b class=verse-num id=v01027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8220;Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <b class=verse-num id=v01027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027013-1>13&nbsp;</b>His mother said to him, &#8220;Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01027013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved. <b class=verse-num id=v01027015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. <b class=verse-num id=v01027016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. <b class=verse-num id=v01027017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p><p id=p01027017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So he went in to his father and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.

What then can I do for you, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Esau said to his father, &#8220;Have you but one blessing, my father?

So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, &#8220;Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. <b class=verse-num id=v01027043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice.

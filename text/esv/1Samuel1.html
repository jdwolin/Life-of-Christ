<h3 id=p09001001_01-1>The Birth of Samuel</h3><p id=p09001001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <b class=verse-num id=v09001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p><p id=p09001002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. <b class=verse-num id=v09001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb. <b class=verse-num id=v09001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb. <b class=verse-num id=v09001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. <b class=verse-num id=v09001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, &#8220;Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?&#8221;</p><p id=p09001008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly. <b class=verse-num id=v09001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And she vowed a vow and said, &#8220;O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.&#8221;</p><p id=p09001011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v09001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. <b class=verse-num id=v09001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Eli said to her, &#8220;How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But Hannah answered, &#8220;No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Eli answered, &#8220;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;Let your servant find favor in your eyes.&#8221; Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p><p id=p09001018_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her. <b class=verse-num id=v09001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, &#8220;I have asked for him from the LORD.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p09001020_05-1>Samuel Given to the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span></h3><p id=p09001020_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow. <b class=verse-num id=v09001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, &#8220;As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Elkanah her husband said to her, &#8220;Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word.&#8221; So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. <b class=verse-num id=v09001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young. <b class=verse-num id=v09001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. <b class=verse-num id=v09001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him. <b class=verse-num id=v09001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p09001028_10-1>And he worshiped the LORD there.</p></div>

They did not know the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&#8217;s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, <b class=verse-num id=v09002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. <b class=verse-num id=v09002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest&#8217;s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, &#8220;Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And if the man said to him, &#8220;Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.</p><p id=p09002017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v09002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v09002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &#8220;May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD.&#8221; So then they would return to their home.</p><p id=p09002020_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters.

For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people. <b class=verse-num id=v09002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad. <b class=verse-num id=v09002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?&#8221; But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.</p><p id=p09002025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.</p><h3 id=p09002026_10-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Rejects Eli&#8217;s Household</h3><p id=p09002026_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh? <b class=verse-num id=v09002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v09002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: &#8216;I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,&#8217; but now the LORD declares: &#8216;Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <b class=verse-num id=v09002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father&#8217;s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. <b class=verse-num id=v09002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever. <b class=verse-num id=v09002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men. <b class=verse-num id=v09002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day. <b class=verse-num id=v09002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever. <b class=verse-num id=v09002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, &#8220;Please put me in one of the priests&#8217; places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

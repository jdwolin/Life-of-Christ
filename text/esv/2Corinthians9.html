<h3 id=p47008001_01-1>Encouragement to Give Generously</h3><p id=p47008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, <b class=verse-num id=v47008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. <b class=verse-num id=v47008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord, <b class=verse-num id=v47008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v47008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us. <b class=verse-num id=v47008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace. <b class=verse-num id=v47008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But as you excel in everything&#8212;in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you&#8212;see that you excel in this act of grace also.</p><p id=p47008007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v47008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. <b class=verse-num id=v47008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. <b class=verse-num id=v47008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it. <b class=verse-num id=v47008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. <b class=verse-num id=v47008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. <b class=verse-num id=v47008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness <b class=verse-num id=v47008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>your abundance at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness. <b class=verse-num id=v47008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As it is written, &#8220;Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p47008015_05-1>Commendation of Titus</h3><p id=p47008015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v47008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you. <b class=verse-num id=v47008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord. <b class=verse-num id=v47008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel. <b class=verse-num id=v47008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace that is being ministered by us, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will. <b class=verse-num id=v47008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us, <b class=verse-num id=v47008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord&#8217;s sight but also in the sight of man. <b class=verse-num id=v47008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you. <b class=verse-num id=v47008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So give proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.</p></div>

And your zeal has stirred up most of them. <b class=verse-num id=v47009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be. <b class=verse-num id=v47009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated&#8212;to say nothing of you&#8212;for being so confident. <b class=verse-num id=v47009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.</p><h3 id=p47009005_07-1>The Cheerful Giver</h3><p id=p47009005_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v47009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. <b class=verse-num id=v47009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. <b class=verse-num id=v47009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. <b class=verse-num id=v47009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>As it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p47009009_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;</span><br /><span id=p47009009_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his righteousness endures forever.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p47009009_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v47009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v47009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. <b class=verse-num id=v47009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. <b class=verse-num id=v47009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others, <b class=verse-num id=v47009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. <b class=verse-num id=v47009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!</p></div>

But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.</p><p id=p47010012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v47010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even to you. <b class=verse-num id=v47010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others. But our hope is that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged, <b class=verse-num id=v47010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another&#8217;s area of influence. <b class=verse-num id=v47010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v47010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</p></div>

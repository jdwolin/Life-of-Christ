<h3 id=p27001001_01-1>Daniel Taken to Babylon</h3><p id=p27001001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. <b class=verse-num id=v27001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. <b class=verse-num id=v27001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility, <b class=verse-num id=v27001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king&#8217;s palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. <b class=verse-num id=v27001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v27001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v27001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.</p><h3 id=p27001007_05-1>Daniel&#8217;s Faithfulness</h3><p id=p27001007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king&#8217;s food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself. <b class=verse-num id=v27001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs, <b class=verse-num id=v27001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, &#8220;I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <b class=verse-num id=v27001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. <b class=verse-num id=v27001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king&#8217;s food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. <b class=verse-num id=v27001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king&#8217;s food. <b class=verse-num id=v27001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</p><p id=p27001016_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <b class=verse-num id=v27001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <b class=verse-num id=v27001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v27001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v27001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.</p></div>

So they came in and stood before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v27002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said to them, &#8220;I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, &#8220;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, &#8220;The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins. <b class=verse-num id=v27002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They answered a second time and said, &#8220;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The king answered and said, &#8220;I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v27002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you.

Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The Chaldeans answered the king and said, &#8220;There is not a man on earth who can meet the king&#8217;s demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. <b class=verse-num id=v27002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&#8221;</p><p id=p27002011_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v27002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. <b class=verse-num id=v27002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them. <b class=verse-num id=v27002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king&#8217;s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v27002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He declared to Arioch, the king&#8217;s captain, &#8220;Why is the decree of the king so urgent?&#8221; Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel. <b class=verse-num id=v27002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.</p><h3 id=p27002016_03-1>God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s Dream</h3><p id=p27002016_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, <b class=verse-num id=v27002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v27002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night.

This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening. <b class=verse-num id=v27002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze, <b class=verse-num id=v27002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. <b class=verse-num id=v27002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. <b class=verse-num id=v27002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</p><p id=p27002035_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v27002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>&#8220;This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27002037-1>37&nbsp;</b>You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory, <b class=verse-num id=v27002038-1>38&nbsp;</b>and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all&#8212;you are the head of gold. <b class=verse-num id=v27002039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v27002040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these. <b class=verse-num id=v27002041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter&#8217;s clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. <b class=verse-num id=v27002042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle. <b class=verse-num id=v27002043-1>43&nbsp;</b>As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay. <b class=verse-num id=v27002044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people.

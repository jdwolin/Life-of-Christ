<h3 id=p14011001_01-1>Rehoboam Secures His Kingdom</h3><p id=p14011001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. <b class=verse-num id=v14011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God: <b class=verse-num id=v14011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, <b class=verse-num id=v14011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.&#8217;&#8221; So they listened to the word of the LORD and returned and did not go against Jeroboam.</p><p id=p14011004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, <b class=verse-num id=v14011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, <b class=verse-num id=v14011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, <b class=verse-num id=v14011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, <b class=verse-num id=v14011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin. <b class=verse-num id=v14011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine. <b class=verse-num id=v14011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.</p><h3 id=p14011012_05-1>Priests and Levites Come to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p14011012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v14011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived. <b class=verse-num id=v14011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v14011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the calves that he had made. <b class=verse-num id=v14011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.</p><h3 id=p14011017_11-1>Rehoboam&#8217;s Family</h3><p id=p14011017_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse, <b class=verse-num id=v14011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. <b class=verse-num id=v14011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. <b class=verse-num id=v14011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters). <b class=verse-num id=v14011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. <b class=verse-num id=v14011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14012001_01-1>Egypt Plunders Jerusalem</h3><p id=p14012001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem <b class=verse-num id=v14012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt&#8212;Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians. <b class=verse-num id=v14012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, &#8220;The LORD is righteous.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: &#8220;They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. <b class=verse-num id=v14012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.&#8221;</p><p id=p14012008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house. He took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made, <b class=verse-num id=v14012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v14012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom. <b class=verse-num id=v14012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, conditions were good in Judah.</p><p id=p14012012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite. <b class=verse-num id=v14012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.</p><p id=p14012014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer? There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. <b class=verse-num id=v14012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

His mother&#8217;s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.</p><p id=p14013002_05-1>Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <b class=verse-num id=v14013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Abijah went out to battle, having an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. And Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with 800,000 chosen mighty warriors. <b class=verse-num id=v14013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, &#8220;Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel! <b class=verse-num id=v14013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt? <b class=verse-num id=v14013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord, <b class=verse-num id=v14013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and certain worthless scoundrels gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them.</p><p id=p14013007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods. <b class=verse-num id=v14013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes for ordination with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v14013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service. <b class=verse-num id=v14013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out the showbread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken him. <b class=verse-num id=v14013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed.&#8221;</p><p id=p14013012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come upon them from behind. Thus his troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them. <b class=verse-num id=v14013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was in front of and behind them. And they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets. <b class=verse-num id=v14013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The men of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand. <b class=verse-num id=v14013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men. <b class=verse-num id=v14013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages. <b class=verse-num id=v14013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down, and he died. <b class=verse-num id=v14013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. <b class=verse-num id=v14013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44007001_01-1>Stephen&#8217;s Speech</h3><p id=p44007001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>And the high priest said, &#8220;Are these things so?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Stephen said:</p><p id=p44007002_03-1>&#8220;Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, <b class=verse-num id=v44007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8216;Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. <b class=verse-num id=v44007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot&#8217;s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. <b class=verse-num id=v44007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And God spoke to this effect&#8212;that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. <b class=verse-num id=v44007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8216;But I will judge the nation that they serve,&#8217; said God, &#8216;and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</p><p id=p44007008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him <b class=verse-num id=v44007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. <b class=verse-num id=v44007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. <b class=verse-num id=v44007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit. <b class=verse-num id=v44007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph&#8217;s family became known to Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v44007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. <b class=verse-num id=v44007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v44007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</p><p id=p44007016_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt <b class=verse-num id=v44007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v44007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God&#8217;s sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father&#8217;s house, <b class=verse-num id=v44007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and when he was exposed, Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. <b class=verse-num id=v44007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</p><p id=p44007022_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v44007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. <b class=verse-num id=v44007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand. <b class=verse-num id=v44007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, &#8216;Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, &#8216;Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? <b class=verse-num id=v44007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</p><p id=p44007029_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. <b class=verse-num id=v44007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord: <b class=verse-num id=v44007032-1>32&nbsp;</b>&#8216;I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.&#8217; And Moses trembled and did not dare to look. <b class=verse-num id=v44007033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then the Lord said to him, &#8216;Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. <b class=verse-num id=v44007034-1>34&nbsp;</b>I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.&#8217;</p><p id=p44007034_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&#8220;This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, &#8216;Who made you a ruler and a judge?&#8217;&#8212;this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <b class=verse-num id=v44007036-1>36&nbsp;</b>This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v44007037-1>37&nbsp;</b>This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, &#8216;God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007038-1>38&nbsp;</b>This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us. <b class=verse-num id=v44007039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v44007040-1>40&nbsp;</b>saying to Aaron, &#8216;Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v44007042-1>42&nbsp;</b>But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44007042_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices,</span><br /><span id=p44007042_03-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44007043-1>43&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You took up the tent of Moloch</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the star of your god Rephan,</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the images that you made to worship;</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44007043_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007044-1>44&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen. <b class=verse-num id=v44007045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers.

The Lord said to him in a vision, <span class=woc>&#8220;Ananias.&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;Here I am, Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Ananias answered, &#8220;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, &#8220;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized; <b class=verse-num id=v44009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and taking food, he was strengthened.</p><h3 id=p44009019_05-1>Saul Proclaims Jesus in Synagogues</h3><p id=p44009019_10-1>For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &#8220;He is the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And all who heard him were amazed and said, &#8220;Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.</p><h3 id=p44009022_10-1>Saul Escapes from Damascus</h3><p id=p44009022_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him, <b class=verse-num id=v44009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him, <b class=verse-num id=v44009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</p><h3 id=p44009025_14-1>Saul in Jerusalem</h3><p id=p44009025_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. <b class=verse-num id=v44009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him. <b class=verse-num id=v44009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</p><p id=p44009030_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.</p><h3 id=p44009031_17-1>The Healing of Aeneas</h3><p id=p44009031_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. <b class=verse-num id=v44009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed. <b class=verse-num id=v44009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to him, &#8220;Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.&#8221; And immediately he rose. <b class=verse-num id=v44009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</p><h3 id=p44009035_21-1>Dorcas Restored to Life</h3><p id=p44009035_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity. <b class=verse-num id=v44009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. <b class=verse-num id=v44009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, &#8220;Please come to us without delay.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. <b class=verse-num id=v44009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, &#8220;Tabitha, arise.&#8221; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. <b class=verse-num id=v44009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then, calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44009042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44009043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.</p></div>

When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah, <b class=verse-num id=v11016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.</p><p id=p11016010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends. <b class=verse-num id=v11016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, <b class=verse-num id=v11016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols. <b class=verse-num id=v11016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p><h3 id=p11016014_05-1>Zimri Reigns in Israel</h3><p id=p11016014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, <b class=verse-num id=v11016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and the troops who were encamped heard it said, &#8220;Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king.&#8221; Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v11016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. <b class=verse-num id=v11016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king&#8217;s house and burned the king&#8217;s house over him with fire and died, <b class=verse-num id=v11016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>because of his sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin. <b class=verse-num id=v11016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p><h3 id=p11016020_09-1>Omri Reigns in Israel</h3><p id=p11016020_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v11016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. <b class=verse-num id=v11016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king. <b class=verse-num id=v11016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah. <b class=verse-num id=v11016024-1>24&nbsp;</b>He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he fortified the hill and called the name of the city that he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.</p><p id=p11016024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v11016025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil than all who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11016026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins that he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols. <b class=verse-num id=v11016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v11016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his place.</p><h3 id=p11016028_13-1>Ahab Reigns in Israel</h3><p id=p11016028_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v11016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. <b class=verse-num id=v11016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him. <b class=verse-num id=v11016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v11016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.</p></div>

He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v11017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook. <b class=verse-num id=v11017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And after a while the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.</p><h3 id=p11017007_05-1>The Widow of Zarephath</h3><p id=p11017007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the word of the LORD came to him, <b class=verse-num id=v11017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, &#8220;Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, &#8220;Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to her, &#8220;Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself and your son. <b class=verse-num id=v11017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;The jar of flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days. <b class=verse-num id=v11017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.</p><h3 id=p11017016_09-1>Elijah Raises the Widow&#8217;s Son</h3><p id=p11017016_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v11017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. <b class=verse-num id=v11017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And she said to Elijah, &#8220;What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, &#8220;Give me your son.&#8221; And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his own bed. <b class=verse-num id=v11017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he cried to the LORD, &#8220;O LORD my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the LORD, &#8220;O LORD my God, let this child&#8217;s life come into him again.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah.

<h3 id=p11018001_01-1>Elijah Confronts Ahab</h3><p id=p11018001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, &#8220;Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v11018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <b class=verse-num id=v11018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <b class=verse-num id=v11018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said to Obadiah, &#8220;Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.</p><p id=p11018006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, &#8220;Is it you, my lord Elijah?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he answered him, &#8220;It is I. Go, tell your lord, &#8216;Behold, Elijah is here.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <b class=verse-num id=v11018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, &#8216;He is not here,&#8217; he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. <b class=verse-num id=v11018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now you say, &#8216;Go, tell your lord, &#8220;Behold, Elijah is here.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth. <b class=verse-num id=v11018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD&#8217;s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water? <b class=verse-num id=v11018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And now you say, &#8216;Go, tell your lord, &#8220;Behold, Elijah is here&#8221;&#8217;; and he will kill me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said, &#8220;As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p><p id=p11018016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, &#8220;Is it you, you troubler of Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he answered, &#8220;I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father&#8217;s house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals. <b class=verse-num id=v11018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel&#8217;s table.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p11018019_04-1>The Prophets of Baal Defeated</h3><p id=p11018019_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. <b class=verse-num id=v11018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Elijah came near to all the people and said, &#8220;How long will you go limping between two different opinions?

And they limped around the altar that they had made. <b class=verse-num id=v11018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, &#8220;Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v11018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.</p><p id=p11018029_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to all the people, &#8220;Come near to me.&#8221; And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down. <b class=verse-num id=v11018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, &#8220;Israel shall be your name,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <b class=verse-num id=v11018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, &#8220;Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Do it a second time.&#8221; And they did it a second time. And he said, &#8220;Do it a third time.&#8221; And they did it a third time. <b class=verse-num id=v11018035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p><p id=p11018035_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, &#8220;O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <b class=verse-num id=v11018037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <b class=verse-num id=v11018039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, &#8220;The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to them, &#8220;Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.&#8221; And they seized them.

<h3 id=p04020001_01-1>The Death of Miriam</h3><p id=p04020001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v04020001-1>20:1&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. And Miriam died there and was buried there.</p><h3 id=p04020001_05-1>The Waters of Meribah</h3><p id=p04020001_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now there was no water for the congregation. And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <b class=verse-num id=v04020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the people quarreled with Moses and said, &#8220;Would that we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD! <b class=verse-num id=v04020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle? <b class=verse-num id=v04020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them, <b class=verse-num id=v04020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</p><h3 id=p04020009_09-1>Moses Strikes the Rock</h3><p id=p04020009_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, &#8220;Hear now, you rebels: shall we bring water for you out of this rock?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, and water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock. <b class=verse-num id=v04020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>These are the waters of Meribah, where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and through them he showed himself holy.</p><h3 id=p04020013_13-1>Edom Refuses Passage</h3><p id=p04020013_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: &#8220;Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that we have met: <b class=verse-num id=v04020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v04020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. <b class=verse-num id=v04020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from a well. We will go along the King&#8217;s Highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But Edom said to him, &#8220;You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel said to him, &#8220;We will go up by the highway, and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then I will pay for it. Let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;You shall not pass through.&#8221; And Edom came out against them with a large army and with a strong force. <b class=verse-num id=v04020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.</p><h3 id=p04020021_16-1>The Death of Aaron</h3><p id=p04020021_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. <b class=verse-num id=v04020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, <b class=verse-num id=v04020024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let Aaron be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the people of Israel, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. <b class=verse-num id=v04020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor. <b class=verse-num id=v04020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall die there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Moses did as the LORD commanded. And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <b class=verse-num id=v04020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v04020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.</p></div>

So the name of the place was called Hormah.</p><h3 id=p04021003_03-1>The Bronze Serpent</h3><p id=p04021003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. <b class=verse-num id=v04021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the people spoke against God and against Moses, &#8220;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. <b class=verse-num id=v04021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the people came to Moses and said, &#8220;We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.&#8221; So Moses prayed for the people. <b class=verse-num id=v04021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.</p><h3 id=p04021009_06-1>The Song of the Well</h3><p id=p04021009_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth. <b class=verse-num id=v04021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise. <b class=verse-num id=v04021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered. <b class=verse-num id=v04021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <b class=verse-num id=v04021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p04021014_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,</span><br /><span id=p04021015_11-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the slope of the valleys</span><br /><span id=p04021015_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;that extends to the seat of Ar,</span><br /><span id=p04021015_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and leans to the border of Moab.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p04021015_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Gather the people together, so that I may give them water.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Israel sang this song:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p04021017_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Spring up, O well!&#8212;Sing to it!&#8212;</span><br /><span id=p04021018_11-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;the well that the princes made,</span><br /><span id=p04021018_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;that the nobles of the people dug,</span><br /><span id=p04021018_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;with the scepter and with their staffs.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p04021018_11-1 class=same-paragraph>And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah, <b class=verse-num id=v04021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, <b class=verse-num id=v04021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert.</p><h3 id=p04021020_11-1>King Sihon Defeated</h3><p id=p04021020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let me pass through your land.

Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Moab said to the elders of Midian, &#8220;This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.&#8221; So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, <b class=verse-num id=v04022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the people of Amaw, to call him, saying, &#8220;Behold, a people has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me. <b class=verse-num id=v04022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me.

Now come, curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>God said to Balaam, &#8220;You shall not go with them.

Come, curse this people for me.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, &#8220;Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD my God to do less or more. <b class=verse-num id=v04022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So you, too, please stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, &#8220;If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only do what I tell you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.</p><h3 id=p04022021_04-1>Balaam&#8217;s Donkey and the Angel</h3><p id=p04022021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But God&#8217;s anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as his adversary.

And Balaam&#8217;s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff. <b class=verse-num id=v04022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &#8220;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Balaam said to the donkey, &#8220;Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the donkey said to Balaam, &#8220;Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p><p id=p04022030_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face. <b class=verse-num id=v04022032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to him, &#8220;Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me. <b class=verse-num id=v04022033-1>33&nbsp;</b>The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, &#8220;I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, &#8220;Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you.&#8221; So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.</p><p id=p04022035_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022036-1>36&nbsp;</b>When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border. <b class=verse-num id=v04022037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And Balak said to Balaam, &#8220;Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Balaam said to Balak, &#8220;Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. <b class=verse-num id=v04022040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him.</p><p id=p04022040_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people.</p></div>

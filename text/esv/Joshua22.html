Therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v06022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.</p><p id=p06022006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan.

And if you too rebel against the LORD today then tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But now, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over into the LORD&#8217;s land where the LORD&#8217;s tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God. <b class=verse-num id=v06022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel?

The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today <b class=verse-num id=v06022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD. Or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance. <b class=verse-num id=v06022024-1>24&nbsp;</b>No, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, &#8216;What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v06022025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you people of Reuben and people of Gad. You have no portion in the LORD.&#8217; So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06022026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Therefore we said, &#8216;Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, <b class=verse-num id=v06022027-1>27&nbsp;</b>but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, so your children will not say to our children in time to come, &#8220;You have no portion in the LORD.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And we thought, &#8216;If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, &#8220;Behold, the copy of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!&#8221;</p><p id=p06022029_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v06022031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh, &#8220;Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this breach of faith against the LORD. Now you have delivered the people of Israel from the hand of the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p06022031_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the people of Reuben and the people of Gad in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them. <b class=verse-num id=v06022033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the report was good in the eyes of the people of Israel. And the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and the people of Gad were settled. <b class=verse-num id=v06022034-1>34&nbsp;</b>The people of Reuben and the people of Gad called the altar Witness, &#8220;For,&#8221; they said, &#8220;it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.&#8221;</p></div>

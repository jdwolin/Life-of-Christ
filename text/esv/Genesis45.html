<h3 id=p01044001_01-1>Joseph Tests His Brothers</h3><p id=p01044001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01044001-1>44:1&nbsp;</b>Then he commanded the steward of his house, &#8220;Fill the men&#8217;s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man&#8217;s money in the mouth of his sack, <b class=verse-num id=v01044002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.&#8221; And he did as Joseph told him.</p><p id=p01044002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044003-1>3&nbsp;</b>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v01044004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, &#8220;Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, &#8216;Why have you repaid evil for good? <b class=verse-num id=v01044005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01044005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. <b class=verse-num id=v01044007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! <b class=verse-num id=v01044008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord&#8217;s house? <b class=verse-num id=v01044009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord&#8217;s servants.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. <b class=verse-num id=v01044012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin&#8217;s sack. <b class=verse-num id=v01044013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.</p><p id=p01044013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph&#8217;s house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01044015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Joseph said to them, &#8220;What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Judah said, &#8220;What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord&#8217;s servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01044017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.&#8221;</p><p id=p01044017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Judah went up to him and said, &#8220;Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord&#8217;s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself. <b class=verse-num id=v01044019-1>19&nbsp;</b>My lord asked his servants, saying, &#8216;Have you a father, or a brother?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And we said to my lord, &#8216;We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother&#8217;s children, and his father loves him.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then you said to your servants, &#8216;Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044022-1>22&nbsp;</b>We said to my lord, &#8216;The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then you said to your servants, &#8216;Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.&#8217;</p><p id=p01044023_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. <b class=verse-num id=v01044025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when our father said, &#8216;Go again, buy us a little food,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044026-1>26&nbsp;</b>we said, &#8216;We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man&#8217;s face unless our youngest brother is with us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then your servant my father said to us, &#8216;You know that my wife bore me two sons. <b class=verse-num id=v01044028-1>28&nbsp;</b>One left me, and I said, &#8220;Surely he has been torn to pieces,&#8221; and I have never seen him since. <b class=verse-num id=v01044029-1>29&nbsp;</b>If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.&#8217;</p><p id=p01044029_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01044030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy&#8217;s life, <b class=verse-num id=v01044031-1>31&nbsp;</b>as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. <b class=verse-num id=v01044032-1>32&nbsp;</b>For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, &#8216;If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01044033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v01044034-1>34&nbsp;</b>For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p01045001_01-1>Joseph Provides for His Brothers and Family</h3><p id=p01045001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01045001-1>45:1&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, &#8220;Make everyone go out from me.&#8221; So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v01045002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it. <b class=verse-num id=v01045003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Joseph said to his brothers, &#8220;I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?&#8221; But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.</p><p id=p01045003_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01045004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Joseph said to his brothers, &#8220;Come near to me, please.&#8221; And they came near. And he said, &#8220;I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01045005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. <b class=verse-num id=v01045006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. <b class=verse-num id=v01045007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. <b class=verse-num id=v01045008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01045009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, &#8216;Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry. <b class=verse-num id=v01045010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children&#8217;s children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. <b class=verse-num id=v01045011-1>11&nbsp;</b>There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01045012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. <b class=verse-num id=v01045013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01045014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin&#8217;s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck. <b class=verse-num id=v01045015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.</p><p id=p01045015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01045016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When the report was heard in Pharaoh&#8217;s house, &#8220;Joseph&#8217;s brothers have come,&#8221; it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v01045017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Say to your brothers, &#8216;Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan, <b class=verse-num id=v01045018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01045019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, &#8216;Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. <b class=verse-num id=v01045020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01045020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01045021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. <b class=verse-num id=v01045022-1>22&nbsp;</b>To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes. <b class=verse-num id=v01045023-1>23&nbsp;</b>To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey. <b class=verse-num id=v01045024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, &#8220;Do not quarrel on the way.&#8221;</p><p id=p01045024_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01045025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob. <b class=verse-num id=v01045026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they told him, &#8220;Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.&#8221; And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them. <b class=verse-num id=v01045027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. <b class=verse-num id=v01045028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Israel said, &#8220;It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.&#8221;</p></div>

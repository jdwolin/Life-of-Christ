<h3 id=p02018001_01-1>Jethro&#8217;s Advice</h3><p id=p02018001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v02018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses&#8217; wife, after he had sent her home, <b class=verse-num id=v02018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, &#8220;I have been a sojourner in a foreign land&#8221;), <b class=verse-num id=v02018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, &#8220;The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh&#8221;). <b class=verse-num id=v02018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God. <b class=verse-num id=v02018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when he sent word to Moses, &#8220;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent. <b class=verse-num id=v02018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&#8217;s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them. <b class=verse-num id=v02018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p><p id=p02018009_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jethro said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v02018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses&#8217; father-in-law before God.</p><p id=p02018012_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening. <b class=verse-num id=v02018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Moses&#8217; father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, &#8220;What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to his father-in-law, &#8220;Because the people come to me to inquire of God; <b class=verse-num id=v02018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Moses&#8217; father-in-law said to him, &#8220;What you are doing is not good. <b class=verse-num id=v02018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone. <b class=verse-num id=v02018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God, <b class=verse-num id=v02018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do. <b class=verse-num id=v02018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. <b class=verse-num id=v02018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. <b class=verse-num id=v02018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.&#8221;</p><p id=p02018023_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. <b class=verse-num id=v02018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. <b class=verse-num id=v02018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v02018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.</p></div>

There Israel encamped before the mountain, <b class=verse-num id=v02019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>while Moses went up to God. The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: <b class=verse-num id=v02019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8216;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&#8217; wings and brought you to myself. <b class=verse-num id=v02019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; <b class=verse-num id=v02019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8217; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him. <b class=verse-num id=v02019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>All the people answered together and said, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do.&#8221; And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019009_05-1>When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v02019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments <b class=verse-num id=v02019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. <b class=verse-num id=v02019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, &#8216;Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v02019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.&#8217; When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v02019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people, &#8220;Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. <b class=verse-num id=v02019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v02019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. <b class=verse-num id=v02019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. <b class=verse-num id=v02019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.

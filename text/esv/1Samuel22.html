<h3 id=p09021001_01-1>David and the Holy Bread</h3><p id=p09021001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09021001-1>21:1&nbsp;</b>Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David, trembling, and said to him, &#8220;Why are you alone, and no one with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, &#8220;The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, &#8216;Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.&#8217; I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place. <b class=verse-num id=v09021003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the priest answered David, &#8220;I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread&#8212;if the young men have kept themselves from women.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David answered the priest, &#8220;Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.</p><p id=p09021006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul&#8217;s herdsmen.</p><p id=p09021007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Ahimelech, &#8220;Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&#8217;s business required haste.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the priest said, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.&#8221; And David said, &#8220;There is none like that; give it to me.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p09021009_06-1>David Flees to Gath</h3><p id=p09021009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath. <b class=verse-num id=v09021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p09021011_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8216;Saul has struck down his thousands,</span><br /><span id=p09021011_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David his ten thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p09021011_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v09021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. <b class=verse-num id=v09021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard. <b class=verse-num id=v09021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Achish said to his servants, &#8220;Behold, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me? <b class=verse-num id=v09021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?&#8221;</p></div>

And when his brothers and all his father&#8217;s house heard it, they went down there to him. <b class=verse-num id=v09022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.</p><p id=p09022002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, &#8220;Please let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. <b class=verse-num id=v09022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the prophet Gad said to David, &#8220;Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.&#8221; So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.</p><h3 id=p09022005_07-1>Saul Kills the Priests at Nob</h3><p id=p09022005_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. <b class=verse-num id=v09022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, &#8220;Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, <b class=verse-num id=v09022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, &#8220;I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, <b class=verse-num id=v09022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.&#8221;</p><p id=p09022010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&#8217;s house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king. <b class=verse-num id=v09022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;Hear now, son of Ahitub.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Here I am, my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimelech answered the king, &#8220;And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king&#8217;s son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house? <b class=verse-num id=v09022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the guard who stood about him, &#8220;Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.&#8221; But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Doeg, &#8220;You turn and strike the priests.&#8221; And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v09022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.</p><p id=p09022019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. <b class=verse-num id=v09022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abiathar, &#8220;I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v09022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. With me you shall be in safekeeping.&#8221;</p></div>

And the LORD answered him, &#8220;Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p><p id=p09023005_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, &#8220;God has given him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. <b class=verse-num id=v09023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him. And he said to Abiathar the priest, &#8220;Bring the ephod here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then David said, &#8220;O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account. <b class=verse-num id=v09023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell your servant.&#8221; And the LORD said, &#8220;He will come down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then David said, &#8220;Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?&#8221; And the LORD said, &#8220;They will surrender you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition. <b class=verse-num id=v09023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.</p><h3 id=p09023014_07-1>Saul Pursues David</h3><p id=p09023014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. <b class=verse-num id=v09023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan, Saul&#8217;s son, rose and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God. <b class=verse-num id=v09023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul my father also knows this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.</p><p id=p09023018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &#8220;Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon? <b class=verse-num id=v09023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now come down, O king, according to all your heart&#8217;s desire to come down, and our part shall be to surrender him into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me. <b class=verse-num id=v09023022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Go, make yet more sure. Know and see the place where his foot is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he is very cunning. <b class=verse-num id=v09023023-1>23&nbsp;</b>See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul.</p><p id=p09023024_10-1>Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. <b class=verse-num id=v09023025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Saul and his men went to seek him.

And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. <b class=verse-num id=v09023026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them, <b class=verse-num id=v09023027-1>27&nbsp;</b>a messenger came to Saul, saying, &#8220;Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid against the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape. <b class=verse-num id=v09023029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of Engedi.</p></div>

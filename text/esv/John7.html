<h3 id=p43006001_01-1>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h3><p id=p43006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. <b class=verse-num id=v43006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick. <b class=verse-num id=v43006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples. <b class=verse-num id=v43006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. <b class=verse-num id=v43006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, <span class=woc>&#8220;Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. <b class=verse-num id=v43006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Philip answered him, &#8220;Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother, said to him, <b class=verse-num id=v43006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have the people sit down.&#8221;</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. <b class=verse-num id=v43006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. <b class=verse-num id=v43006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten. <b class=verse-num id=v43006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, &#8220;This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!&#8221;</p><p id=p43006014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p><h3 id=p43006015_06-1>Jesus Walks on Water</h3><p id=p43006015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v43006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. <b class=verse-num id=v43006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. <b class=verse-num id=v43006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened. <b class=verse-num id=v43006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is I; do not be afraid.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</p><h3 id=p43006021_10-1>I Am the Bread of Life</h3><p id=p43006021_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. <b class=verse-num id=v43006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <b class=verse-num id=v43006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</p><p id=p43006024_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, when did you come here?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then they said to him, &#8220;What must we do, to be doing the works of God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So they said to him, &#8220;Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? <b class=verse-num id=v43006031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, &#8216;He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Jesus then said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006034-1>34&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Sir, give us this bread always.&#8221;</p><p id=p43006034_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43006040_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am the bread that came down from heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006042-1>42&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, <span class=woc>&#8216;I have come down from heaven&#8217;</span>?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not grumble among yourselves.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006045-1>45&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>It is written in the Prophets, &#8216;And they will all be taught by God.&#8217; Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me&#8212;</span><b class=verse-num woc id=v43006046-1>46&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006048-1>48&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the bread of life.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006049-1>49&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006050-1>50&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006051-1>51&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43006051_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, &#8220;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006053-1>53&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006054-1>54&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006055-1>55&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006056-1>56&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006057-1>57&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006058-1>58&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006059-1>59&nbsp;</b>Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.</p><h3 id=p43006059_16-1>The Words of Eternal Life</h3><p id=p43006059_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006060-1>60&nbsp;</b>When many of his disciples heard it, they said, &#8220;This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006061-1>61&nbsp;</b>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you take offense at this?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006062-1>62&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006063-1>63&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43006064-1>64&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But there are some of you who do not believe.&#8221;</span> (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) <b class=verse-num id=v43006065-1>65&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43006065_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v43006066-1>66&nbsp;</b>After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. <b class=verse-num id=v43006067-1>67&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to the twelve, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you want to go away as well?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006068-1>68&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter answered him, &#8220;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, <b class=verse-num id=v43006069-1>69&nbsp;</b>and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43006070-1>70&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43006071-1>71&nbsp;</b>He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</p></div>

<h3 id=p43007001_01-1>Jesus at the Feast of Booths</h3><p id=p43007001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. <b class=verse-num id=v43007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now the Jews&#8217; Feast of Booths was at hand. <b class=verse-num id=v43007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So his brothers said to him, &#8220;Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. <b class=verse-num id=v43007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For not even his brothers believed in him. <b class=verse-num id=v43007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</p><p id=p43007009_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. <b class=verse-num id=v43007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, &#8220;He is a good man,&#8221; others said, &#8220;No, he is leading the people astray.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.</p><p id=p43007013_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. <b class=verse-num id=v43007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, &#8220;How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If anyone&#8217;s will is to do God&#8217;s will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The crowd answered, &#8220;You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I did one work, and you all marvel at it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man&#8217;s whole body well?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43007024_07-1>Can This Be the Christ?</h3><p id=p43007024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, &#8220;Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? <b class=verse-num id=v43007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? <b class=verse-num id=v43007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, <span class=woc>&#8220;You know me, and you know where I come from.

He who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43007029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. <b class=verse-num id=v43007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Yet many of the people believed in him.

<p id=p43008001_01-1 class=virtual><b class=chapter-num id=v43008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <b class=verse-num id=v43008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. <b class=verse-num id=v43008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst <b class=verse-num id=v43008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>they said to him, &#8220;Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. <b class=verse-num id=v43008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v43008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v43008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. <b class=verse-num id=v43008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus stood up and said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>She said, &#8220;No one, Lord.&#8221; And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43008011_01-1>I Am the Light of the World</h3><p id=p43008011_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=verse-num id=v43008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So the Pharisees said to him, &#8220;You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They said to him therefore, &#8220;Where is your Father?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</p><p id=p43008020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So he said to them again, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin.

You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So they said to him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father. <b class=verse-num id=v43008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>As he was saying these things, many believed in him.</p><h3 id=p43008030_08-1>The Truth Will Set You Free</h3><p id=p43008030_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone.

This is not what Abraham did.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You are doing the works your father did.&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father&#8212;even God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&#8217;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008045-1>45&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008046-1>46&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43008047_21-1>Before Abraham Was, I Am</h3><p id=p43008047_26-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008048-1>48&nbsp;</b>The Jews answered him, &#8220;Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008050-1>50&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008051-1>51&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The Jews said to him, &#8220;Now we know that you have a demon!

And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008054-1>54&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.

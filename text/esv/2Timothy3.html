<h3 id=p55002001_01-1>A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus</h3><p id=p55002001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v55002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v55002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. <b class=verse-num id=v55002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v55002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. <b class=verse-num id=v55002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. <b class=verse-num id=v55002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. <b class=verse-num id=v55002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</p><p id=p55002007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, <b class=verse-num id=v55002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! <b class=verse-num id=v55002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <b class=verse-num id=v55002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The saying is trustworthy, for:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p55002011_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have died with him, we will also live with him;</span><br /><span id=p55002012_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v55002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;if we endure, we will also reign with him;</span><br /><span id=p55002012_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;if we deny him, he also will deny us;</span><br /><span id=p55002013_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v55002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;if we are faithless, he remains faithful&#8212;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p55002013_07-1 class=same-paragraph>for he cannot deny himself.</p><h3 id=p55002013_07-1>A Worker Approved by God</h3><p id=p55002013_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. <b class=verse-num id=v55002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. <b class=verse-num id=v55002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, <b class=verse-num id=v55002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <b class=verse-num id=v55002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. <b class=verse-num id=v55002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But God&#8217;s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are his,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.&#8221;</p><p id=p55002019_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. <b class=verse-num id=v55002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</p><p id=p55002021_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v55002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. <b class=verse-num id=v55002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. <b class=verse-num id=v55002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the Lord&#8217;s servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, <b class=verse-num id=v55002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, <b class=verse-num id=v55002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</p></div>

Avoid such people. <b class=verse-num id=v55003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, <b class=verse-num id=v55003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v55003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. <b class=verse-num id=v55003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.</p><h3 id=p55003009_06-1>All Scripture Is Breathed Out by God</h3><p id=p55003009_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v55003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, <b class=verse-num id=v55003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra&#8212;which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. <b class=verse-num id=v55003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, <b class=verse-num id=v55003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. <b class=verse-num id=v55003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it <b class=verse-num id=v55003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v55003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, <b class=verse-num id=v55003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</p></div>

Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. <b class=verse-num id=v55004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry. <b class=verse-num id=v55004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. <b class=verse-num id=v55004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments. <b class=verse-num id=v55004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. <b class=verse-num id=v55004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message. <b class=verse-num id=v55004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! <b class=verse-num id=v55004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion&#8217;s mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v55004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever.

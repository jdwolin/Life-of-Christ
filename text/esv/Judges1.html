<h3 id=p07001001_01-1>The Continuing Conquest of Canaan</h3><p id=p07001001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the LORD, &#8220;Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The LORD said, &#8220;Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, &#8220;Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you.&#8221; So Simeon went with him. <b class=verse-num id=v07001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek. <b class=verse-num id=v07001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <b class=verse-num id=v07001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. <b class=verse-num id=v07001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Adoni-bezek said, &#8220;Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.&#8221; And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</p><p id=p07001007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. <b class=verse-num id=v07001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland. <b class=verse-num id=v07001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.</p><p id=p07001010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher. <b class=verse-num id=v07001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Caleb said, &#8220;He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife. <b class=verse-num id=v07001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>She said to him, &#8220;Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.&#8221; And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</p><p id=p07001015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people. <b class=verse-num id=v07001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called Hormah. <b class=verse-num id=v07001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. <b class=verse-num id=v07001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron. <b class=verse-num id=v07001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak. <b class=verse-num id=v07001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</p><p id=p07001021_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them. <b class=verse-num id=v07001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.) <b class=verse-num id=v07001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, &#8220;Please show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. <b class=verse-num id=v07001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day.</p><h3 id=p07001026_06-1>Failure to Complete the Conquest</h3><p id=p07001026_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. <b class=verse-num id=v07001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.</p><p id=p07001028_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.</p><p id=p07001029_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.</p><p id=p07001030_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob, <b class=verse-num id=v07001032-1>32&nbsp;</b>so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.</p><p id=p07001032_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.</p><p id=p07001033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v07001034-1>34&nbsp;</b>The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain. <b class=verse-num id=v07001035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. <b class=verse-num id=v07001036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.</p></div>

<h3 id=p07002001_01-1>Israel&#8217;s Disobedience</h3><p id=p07002001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, &#8220;I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, &#8216;I will never break my covenant with you, <b class=verse-num id=v07002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.&#8217; But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done? <b class=verse-num id=v07002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>As soon as the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept. <b class=verse-num id=v07002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they called the name of that place Bochim. And they sacrificed there to the LORD.</p><h3 id=p07002005_03-1>The Death of Joshua</h3><p id=p07002005_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v07002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v07002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110 years. <b class=verse-num id=v07002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. <b class=verse-num id=v07002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel.</p><h3 id=p07002010_07-1>Israel&#8217;s Unfaithfulness</h3><p id=p07002010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v07002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals. <b class=verse-num id=v07002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the LORD to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v07002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>They abandoned the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. <b class=verse-num id=v07002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v07002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them for harm, as the LORD had warned, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.</p><h3 id=p07002015_09-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Raises Up Judges</h3><p id=p07002015_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v07002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. <b class=verse-num id=v07002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD, and they did not do so. <b class=verse-num id=v07002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them. <b class=verse-num id=v07002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways. <b class=verse-num id=v07002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he said, &#8220;Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice, <b class=verse-num id=v07002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, <b class=verse-num id=v07002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So the LORD left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p></div>

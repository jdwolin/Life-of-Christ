<h3 id=p09008001_01-1>Israel Demands a King</h3><p id=p09008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v09008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. <b class=verse-num id=v09008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Yet his sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after gain. They took bribes and perverted justice.</p><p id=p09008003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah <b class=verse-num id=v09008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, &#8220;Give us a king to judge us.&#8221; And Samuel prayed to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. <b class=verse-num id=v09008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>According to all the deeds that they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you. <b class=verse-num id=v09008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now then, obey their voice; only you shall solemnly warn them and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p09008009_05-1>Samuel&#8217;s Warning Against Kings</h3><p id=p09008009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v09008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking for a king from him. <b class=verse-num id=v09008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots. <b class=verse-num id=v09008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots. <b class=verse-num id=v09008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. <b class=verse-num id=v09008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v09008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v09008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men and your donkeys, and put them to his work. <b class=verse-num id=v09008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. <b class=verse-num id=v09008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p09008018_09-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Grants Israel&#8217;s Request</h3><p id=p09008018_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v09008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, &#8220;No! But there shall be a king over us, <b class=verse-num id=v09008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;Obey their voice and make them a king.&#8221; Samuel then said to the men of Israel, &#8220;Go every man to his city.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09009001_01-1>Saul Chosen to Be King</h3><p id=p09009001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth. <b class=verse-num id=v09009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.</p><p id=p09009002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul&#8217;s father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, &#8220;Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.</p><p id=p09009004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, &#8220;Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the donkeys and become anxious about us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he said to him, &#8220;Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes true. So now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us the way we should go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to his servant, &#8220;But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The servant answered Saul again, &#8220;Here, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, &#8220;Come, let us go to the seer,&#8221; for today&#8217;s &#8220;prophet&#8221; was formerly called a seer.) <b class=verse-num id=v09009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to his servant, &#8220;Well said; come, let us go.&#8221; So they went to the city where the man of God was.</p><p id=p09009010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>As they went up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water and said to them, &#8220;Is the seer here?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>They answered, &#8220;He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Hurry. He has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place. <b class=verse-num id=v09009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As soon as you enter the city you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.</p><p id=p09009014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel: <b class=verse-num id=v09009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen my people, because their cry has come to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, &#8220;Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall restrain my people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, &#8220;Tell me where is the house of the seer?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Samuel answered Saul, &#8220;I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind. <b class=verse-num id=v09009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father&#8217;s house?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Saul answered, &#8220;Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the humblest of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?&#8221;</p><p id=p09009021_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons. <b class=verse-num id=v09009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to the cook, &#8220;Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, &#8216;Put it aside.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So the cook took up the leg and what was on it and set them before Saul. And Samuel said, &#8220;See, what was kept is set before you. Eat, because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests.&#8221;</p><p id=p09009024_06-1>So Saul ate with Samuel that day. <b class=verse-num id=v09009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep. <b class=verse-num id=v09009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, &#8220;Up, that I may send you on your way.&#8221; So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.</p><p id=p09009026_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on, stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09010001_01-1>Saul Anointed King</h3><p id=p09010001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said, &#8220;Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince over his people Israel? And you shall reign over the people of the LORD and you will save them from the hand of their surrounding enemies. And this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you to be prince over his heritage. <b class=verse-num id=v09010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by Rachel&#8217;s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, &#8216;The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, &#8220;What shall I do about my son?&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then you shall go on from there farther and come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. <b class=verse-num id=v09010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim, where there is a garrison of the Philistines. And there, as soon as you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying. <b class=verse-num id=v09010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man. <b class=verse-num id=v09010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now when these signs meet you, do what your hand finds to do, for God is with you. <b class=verse-num id=v09010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then go down before me to Gilgal. And behold, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.&#8221;</p><p id=p09010008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all these signs came to pass that day. <b class=verse-num id=v09010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When they came to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them. <b class=verse-num id=v09010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when all who knew him previously saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, &#8220;What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And a man of the place answered, &#8220;And who is their father?&#8221; Therefore it became a proverb, &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.</p><p id=p09010013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Saul&#8217;s uncle said to him and to his servant, &#8220;Where did you go?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;To seek the donkeys. And when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Saul&#8217;s uncle said, &#8220;Please tell me what Samuel said to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to his uncle, &#8220;He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.&#8221; But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.</p><h3 id=p09010016_04-1>Saul Proclaimed King</h3><p id=p09010016_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah. <b class=verse-num id=v09010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people of Israel, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, &#8216;Set a king over us.&#8217; Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands.&#8221;</p><p id=p09010019_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. <b class=verse-num id=v09010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot; and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found. <b class=verse-num id=v09010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So they inquired again of the LORD, &#8220;Is there a man still to come?&#8221; and the LORD said, &#8220;Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. <b class=verse-num id=v09010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to all the people, &#8220;Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people.&#8221; And all the people shouted, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</p><p id=p09010024_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship, and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home. <b class=verse-num id=v09010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. <b class=verse-num id=v09010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But some worthless fellows said, &#8220;How can this man save us?&#8221; And they despised him and brought him no present.

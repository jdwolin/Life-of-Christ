Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it. <b class=verse-num id=v13010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died. <b class=verse-num id=v13010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together. <b class=verse-num id=v13010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.</p><p id=p13010007_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v13010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. <b class=verse-num id=v13010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v13010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. <b class=verse-num id=v13010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, <b class=verse-num id=v13010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.</p><p id=p13010012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v13010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance. <b class=verse-num id=v13010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.</p></div>

He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.</p><p id=p13011011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite. <b class=verse-num id=v13011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v13011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the LORD saved them by a great victory.</p><p id=p13011014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v13011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. <b class=verse-num id=v13011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And David said longingly, &#8220;Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David.

He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. <b class=verse-num id=v13011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver&#8217;s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian&#8217;s hand and killed him with his own spear. <b class=verse-num id=v13011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men. <b class=verse-num id=v13011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three.

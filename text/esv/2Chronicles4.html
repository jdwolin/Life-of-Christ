<h3 id=p14003001_01-1>Solomon Builds the Temple</h3><p id=p14003001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <b class=verse-num id=v14003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. <b class=verse-num id=v14003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>These are Solomon&#8217;s measurements for building the house of God: the length, in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v14003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold and made palms and chains on it. <b class=verse-num id=v14003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim. <b class=verse-num id=v14003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So he lined the house with gold&#8212;its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors&#8212;and he carved cherubim on the walls.</p><p id=p14003007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits. He overlaid it with 600 talents of fine gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The weight of gold for the nails was fifty shekels. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</p><p id=p14003009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of wood and overlaid them with gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub; <b class=verse-num id=v14003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub. <b class=verse-num id=v14003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. The cherubim stood on their feet, facing the nave. <b class=verse-num id=v14003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.</p><p id=p14003014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each. <b class=verse-num id=v14003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains. <b class=verse-num id=v14003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz.</p></div>

It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. <b class=verse-num id=v14004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Under it were figures of gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. <b class=verse-num id=v14004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward. <b class=verse-num id=v14004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Its thickness was a handbreadth. And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held 3,000 baths. <b class=verse-num id=v14004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.</p><p id=p14004006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v14004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.

So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God: <b class=verse-num id=v14004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; <b class=verse-num id=v14004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and the 400 pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars. <b class=verse-num id=v14004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He made the stands also, and the basins on the stands, <b class=verse-num id=v14004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it. <b class=verse-num id=v14004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. <b class=verse-num id=v14004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Solomon made all these things in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze was not sought.</p><p id=p14004018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence, <b class=verse-num id=v14004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed; <b class=verse-num id=v14004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold; <b class=verse-num id=v14004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold, and the sockets of the temple, for the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.</p></div>

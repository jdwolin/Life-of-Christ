And I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v13017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly, <b class=verse-num id=v13017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house. <b class=verse-num id=v13017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v13017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. <b class=verse-num id=v13017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, <b class=verse-num id=v13017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.</p><h3 id=p13017015_06-1>David&#8217;s Prayer</h3><p id=p13017015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v13017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, &#8220;Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? <b class=verse-num id=v13017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God. You have also spoken of your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, O LORD God! <b class=verse-num id=v13017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v13017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For your servant&#8217;s sake, O LORD, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. <b class=verse-num id=v13017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>There is none like you, O LORD, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <b class=verse-num id=v13017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and awesome things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt? <b class=verse-num id=v13017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And you made your people Israel to be your people forever, and you, O LORD, became their God. <b class=verse-num id=v13017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken, <b class=verse-num id=v13017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, &#8216;The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel&#8217;s God,&#8217; and the house of your servant David will be established before you. <b class=verse-num id=v13017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. <b class=verse-num id=v13017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v13017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O LORD, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever.&#8221;</p></div>

And David&#8217;s servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, &#8220;Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Hanun took David&#8217;s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away; <b class=verse-num id=v13019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, &#8220;Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.&#8221;</p><p id=p13019005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. <b class=verse-num id=v13019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle. <b class=verse-num id=v13019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. <b class=verse-num id=v13019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</p><h3 id=p13019009_06-1>Ammonites and Syrians Defeated</h3><p id=p13019009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians. <b class=verse-num id=v13019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v13019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. <b class=verse-num id=v13019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab&#8217;s brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p13019015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. <b class=verse-num id=v13019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army. <b class=verse-num id=v13019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him.

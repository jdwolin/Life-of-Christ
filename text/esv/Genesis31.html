<p id=p01030001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01030001-1>30:1&nbsp;</b>When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, &#8220;Give me children, or I shall die!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Jacob&#8217;s anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, &#8220;Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then she said, &#8220;Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her. <b class=verse-num id=v01030005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. <b class=verse-num id=v01030006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Rachel said, &#8220;God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son.&#8221; Therefore she called his name Dan. <b class=verse-num id=v01030007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Rachel&#8217;s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. <b class=verse-num id=v01030008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Rachel said, &#8220;With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed.&#8221; So she called his name Naphtali.</p><p id=p01030008_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v01030009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01030010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Leah&#8217;s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son. <b class=verse-num id=v01030011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Leah said, &#8220;Good fortune has come!&#8221; so she called his name Gad. <b class=verse-num id=v01030012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Leah&#8217;s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. <b class=verse-num id=v01030013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Leah said, &#8220;Happy am I! For women have called me happy.&#8221; So she called his name Asher.</p><p id=p01030013_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v01030014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, &#8220;Please give me some of your son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But she said to her, &#8220;Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son&#8217;s mandrakes also?&#8221; Rachel said, &#8220;Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, &#8220;You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221; So he lay with her that night. <b class=verse-num id=v01030017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. <b class=verse-num id=v01030018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Leah said, &#8220;God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband.&#8221; So she called his name Issachar.</p><p id=p01030018_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v01030019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son. <b class=verse-num id=v01030020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Leah said, &#8220;God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.&#8221; So she called his name Zebulun. <b class=verse-num id=v01030021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.</p><p id=p01030021_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v01030022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb. <b class=verse-num id=v01030023-1>23&nbsp;</b>She conceived and bore a son and said, &#8220;God has taken away my reproach.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And she called his name Joseph, saying, &#8220;May the LORD add to me another son!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01030024_01-1>Jacob&#8217;s Prosperity</h3><p id=p01030024_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v01030025-1>25&nbsp;</b>As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country. <b class=verse-num id=v01030026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Laban said to him, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you. <b class=verse-num id=v01030028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Name your wages, and I will give it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to him, &#8220;You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me. <b class=verse-num id=v01030030-1>30&nbsp;</b>For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;What shall I give you?&#8221; Jacob said, &#8220;You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it: <b class=verse-num id=v01030032-1>32&nbsp;</b>let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages. <b class=verse-num id=v01030033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Laban said, &#8220;Good! Let it be as you have said.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01030035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in the charge of his sons. <b class=verse-num id=v01030036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And he set a distance of three days&#8217; journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban&#8217;s flock.</p><p id=p01030036_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v01030037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks. <b class=verse-num id=v01030038-1>38&nbsp;</b>He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink, <b class=verse-num id=v01030039-1>39&nbsp;</b>the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. <b class=verse-num id=v01030040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban&#8217;s flock. <b class=verse-num id=v01030041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks, <b class=verse-num id=v01030042-1>42&nbsp;</b>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban&#8217;s, and the stronger Jacob&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v01030043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</p></div>

But the God of my father has been with me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031006-1>6&nbsp;</b>You know that I have served your father with all my strength, <b class=verse-num id=v01031007-1>7&nbsp;</b>yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If he said, &#8216;The spotted shall be your wages,&#8217; then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, &#8216;The striped shall be your wages,&#8217; then all the flock bore striped. <b class=verse-num id=v01031009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled. <b class=verse-num id=v01031011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, &#8216;Jacob,&#8217; and I said, &#8216;Here I am!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01031012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8216;Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. <b class=verse-num id=v01031013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, &#8220;Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father&#8217;s house? <b class=verse-num id=v01031015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <b class=verse-num id=v01031016-1>16&nbsp;</b>All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <b class=verse-num id=v01031018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v01031019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father&#8217;s household gods. <b class=verse-num id=v01031020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee. <b class=verse-num id=v01031021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</p><p id=p01031021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <b class=verse-num id=v01031023-1>23&nbsp;</b>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v01031024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v01031026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword? <b class=verse-num id=v01031027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre? <b class=verse-num id=v01031028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly. <b class=verse-num id=v01031029-1>29&nbsp;</b>It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, &#8216;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01031030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father&#8217;s house, but why did you steal my gods?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Jacob answered and said to Laban, &#8220;Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. <b class=verse-num id=v01031032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.&#8221; Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</p><p id=p01031032_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So Laban went into Jacob&#8217;s tent and into Leah&#8217;s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah&#8217;s tent and entered Rachel&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v01031034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel&#8217;s saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them. <b class=verse-num id=v01031035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And she said to her father, &#8220;Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.&#8221; So he searched but did not find the household gods.</p><p id=p01031035_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? <b class=verse-num id=v01031037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two. <b class=verse-num id=v01031038-1>38&nbsp;</b>These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks. <b class=verse-num id=v01031039-1>39&nbsp;</b>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <b class=verse-num id=v01031040-1>40&nbsp;</b>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v01031041-1>41&nbsp;</b>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. <b class=verse-num id=v01031042-1>42&nbsp;</b>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031042_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, &#8220;The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne? <b class=verse-num id=v01031044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031045-1>45&nbsp;</b>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. <b class=verse-num id=v01031046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, &#8220;Gather stones.&#8221; And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. <b class=verse-num id=v01031047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. <b class=verse-num id=v01031048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Laban said, &#8220;This heap is a witness between you and me today.&#8221; Therefore he named it Galeed, <b class=verse-num id=v01031049-1>49&nbsp;</b>and Mizpah, for he said, &#8220;The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another&#8217;s sight. <b class=verse-num id=v01031050-1>50&nbsp;</b>If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031050_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Then Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031052-1>52&nbsp;</b>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. <b class=verse-num id=v01031053-1>53&nbsp;</b>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.&#8221; So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, <b class=verse-num id=v01031054-1>54&nbsp;</b>and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.</p><p id=p01031054_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031055-1>55&nbsp;</b>Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.</p></div>

He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, <b class=verse-num id=v01032008-1>8&nbsp;</b>thinking, &#8220;If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.&#8221;</p><p id=p01032008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said, &#8220;O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, &#8216;Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01032010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps. <b class=verse-num id=v01032011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children. <b class=verse-num id=v01032012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But you said, &#8216;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01032012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau, <b class=verse-num id=v01032014-1>14&nbsp;</b>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <b class=verse-num id=v01032015-1>15&nbsp;</b>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v01032016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, &#8220;Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He instructed the first, &#8220;When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, &#8216;To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>then you shall say, &#8216;They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, &#8220;You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him, <b class=verse-num id=v01032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and you shall say, &#8216;Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; For he thought, &#8220;I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p><h3 id=p01032021_04-1>Jacob Wrestles with God</h3><p id=p01032021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. <b class=verse-num id=v01032023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had. <b class=verse-num id=v01032024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. <b class=verse-num id=v01032025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob&#8217;s hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Let me go, for the day has broken.&#8221; But Jacob said, &#8220;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Jacob.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob asked him, &#8220;Please tell me your name.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;Why is it that you ask my name?&#8221; And there he blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip. <b class=verse-num id=v01032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip on the sinew of the thigh.</p></div>

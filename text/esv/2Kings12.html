Thus they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v12011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he remained with her six years, hidden in the house of the LORD, while Athaliah reigned over the land.</p><h3 id=p12011003_05-1>Joash Anointed King in Judah</h3><p id=p12011003_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of the Carites and of the guards, and had them come to him in the house of the LORD. And he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and he showed them the king&#8217;s son. <b class=verse-num id=v12011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he commanded them, &#8220;This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, those who come off duty on the Sabbath and guard the king&#8217;s house <b class=verse-num id=v12011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>(another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards) shall guard the palace. <b class=verse-num id=v12011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the Sabbath and guard the house of the LORD on behalf of the king, <b class=verse-num id=v12011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever approaches the ranks is to be put to death. Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.&#8221;</p><p id=p12011008_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The captains did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. <b class=verse-num id=v12011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the priest gave to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David&#8217;s, which were in the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house on behalf of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v12011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then he brought out the king&#8217;s son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they proclaimed him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</p><p id=p12011012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the LORD to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v12011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, &#8220;Treason! Treason!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains who were set over the army, &#8220;Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death with the sword anyone who follows her.&#8221; For the priest said, &#8220;Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So they laid hands on her; and she went through the horses&#8217; entrance to the king&#8217;s house, and there she was put to death.</p><p id=p12011016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v12011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people, that they should be the LORD&#8217;s people, and also between the king and the people. <b class=verse-num id=v12011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest posted watchmen over the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he took the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the gate of the guards to the king&#8217;s house. And he took his seat on the throne of the kings. <b class=verse-num id=v12011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword at the king&#8217;s house.</p><h3 id=p12011020_10-1>Jehoash Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p12011020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v12011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.</p></div>

<p id=p12012001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. <b class=verse-num id=v12012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him. <b class=verse-num id=v12012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and make offerings on the high places.</p><h3 id=p12012003_01-1>Jehoash Repairs the Temple</h3><p id=p12012003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Jehoash said to the priests, &#8220;All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the LORD, the money for which each man is assessed&#8212;the money from the assessment of persons&#8212;and the money that a man&#8217;s heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v12012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>let the priests take, each from his donor, and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests had made no repairs on the house. <b class=verse-num id=v12012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, &#8220;Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore take no more money from your donors, but hand it over for the repair of the house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the people, and that they should not repair the house.</p><p id=p12012008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the LORD. And the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king&#8217;s secretary and the high priest came up and they bagged and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD. And they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v12012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the LORD, and for any outlay for the repairs of the house. <b class=verse-num id=v12012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v12012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of the LORD with it. <b class=verse-num id=v12012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they did not ask for an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt honestly. <b class=verse-num id=v12012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.</p><p id=p12012016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>At that time Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath and took it. But when Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v12012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred gifts, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king&#8217;s house, and sent these to Hazael king of Syria.

The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Take a bow and arrows.&#8221; So he took a bow and arrows. <b class=verse-num id=v12013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then he said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Draw the bow,&#8221; and he drew it. And Elisha laid his hands on the king&#8217;s hands. <b class=verse-num id=v12013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Open the window eastward,&#8221; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, &#8220;Shoot,&#8221; and he shot. And he said, &#8220;The LORD&#8217;s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Take the arrows,&#8221; and he took them.

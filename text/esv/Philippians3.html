<h3 id=p50002001_01-1>Christ&#8217;s Example of Humility</h3><p id=p50002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v50002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, <b class=verse-num id=v50002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. <b class=verse-num id=v50002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. <b class=verse-num id=v50002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. <b class=verse-num id=v50002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v50002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, <b class=verse-num id=v50002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. <b class=verse-num id=v50002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. <b class=verse-num id=v50002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, <b class=verse-num id=v50002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, <b class=verse-num id=v50002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p><h3 id=p50002011_05-1>Lights in the World</h3><p id=p50002011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v50002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, <b class=verse-num id=v50002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p><p id=p50002013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v50002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Do all things without grumbling or disputing, <b class=verse-num id=v50002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, <b class=verse-num id=v50002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. <b class=verse-num id=v50002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. <b class=verse-num id=v50002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</p><h3 id=p50002018_09-1>Timothy and Epaphroditus</h3><p id=p50002018_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v50002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. <b class=verse-num id=v50002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. <b class=verse-num id=v50002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v50002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But you know Timothy&#8217;s proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. <b class=verse-num id=v50002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, <b class=verse-num id=v50002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</p><p id=p50002024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v50002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, <b class=verse-num id=v50002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. <b class=verse-num id=v50002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. <b class=verse-num id=v50002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. <b class=verse-num id=v50002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, <b class=verse-num id=v50002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</p></div>

<h3 id=p50003001_01-1>Righteousness Through Faith in Christ</h3><p id=p50003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v50003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.</p><p id=p50003001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v50003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v50003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v50003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: <b class=verse-num id=v50003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; <b class=verse-num id=v50003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. <b class=verse-num id=v50003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v50003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ <b class=verse-num id=v50003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v50003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, <b class=verse-num id=v50003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p><h3 id=p50003011_06-1>Straining Toward the Goal</h3><p id=p50003011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v50003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. <b class=verse-num id=v50003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, <b class=verse-num id=v50003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v50003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. <b class=verse-num id=v50003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</p><p id=p50003016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v50003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. <b class=verse-num id=v50003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v50003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. <b class=verse-num id=v50003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v50003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</p></div>

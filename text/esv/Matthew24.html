For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The greatest among you shall be your servant.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</span></p><p id=p40023012_08-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40023013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And you say, &#8216;If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40023019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You blind men!

Then he went away.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master&#8217;s money.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, &#8216;Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>His master said to him, &#8216;Well done, good and faithful servant.

Enter into the joy of your master.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, &#8216;Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>His master said to him, &#8216;Well done, good and faithful servant.

Enter into the joy of your master.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, &#8216;Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But his master answered him, &#8216;You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8217;</span></p><h3 id=p40025030_12-1>The Final Judgment</h3><p id=p40025030_15-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40025031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then the King will say to those on his right, &#8216;Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, &#8216;Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the King will answer them, &#8216;Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.&#8217;</span></p><p id=p40025040_15-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40025041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Then he will say to those on his left, &#8216;Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then they also will answer, saying, &#8216;Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025045-1>45&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then he will answer them, saying, &#8216;Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025046-1>46&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&#8221;</span></p></div>

<h3 id=p46010001_01-1>Warning Against Idolatry</h3><p id=p46010001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v46010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v46010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and all ate the same spiritual food, <b class=verse-num id=v46010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</p><p id=p46010005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. <b class=verse-num id=v46010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, &#8220;The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. <b class=verse-num id=v46010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, <b class=verse-num id=v46010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. <b class=verse-num id=v46010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. <b class=verse-num id=v46010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. <b class=verse-num id=v46010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</p><p id=p46010013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. <b class=verse-num id=v46010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. <b class=verse-num id=v46010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? <b class=verse-num id=v46010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. <b class=verse-num id=v46010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? <b class=verse-num id=v46010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <b class=verse-num id=v46010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. <b class=verse-num id=v46010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. <b class=verse-num id=v46010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p><h3 id=p46010022_04-1>Do All to the Glory of God</h3><p id=p46010022_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;All things are lawful,&#8221; but not all things are helpful. &#8220;All things are lawful,&#8221; but not all things build up. <b class=verse-num id=v46010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. <b class=verse-num id=v46010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v46010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For &#8220;the earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the fullness thereof.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v46010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But if someone says to you, &#8220;This has been offered in sacrifice,&#8221; then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else&#8217;s conscience? <b class=verse-num id=v46010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?</p><p id=p46010030_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, <b class=verse-num id=v46010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.</p></div>

<p id=p46011001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.</p><h3 id=p46011001_01-1>Head Coverings</h3><p id=p46011001_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. <b class=verse-num id=v46011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. <b class=verse-num id=v46011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, <b class=verse-num id=v46011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. <b class=verse-num id=v46011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. <b class=verse-num id=v46011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <b class=verse-num id=v46011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; <b class=verse-num id=v46011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. <b class=verse-num id=v46011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? <b class=verse-num id=v46011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, <b class=verse-num id=v46011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. <b class=verse-num id=v46011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p><h3 id=p46011016_03-1>The Lord&#8217;s Supper</h3><p id=p46011016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. <b class=verse-num id=v46011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <b class=verse-num id=v46011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. <b class=verse-num id=v46011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When you come together, it is not the Lord&#8217;s supper that you eat. <b class=verse-num id=v46011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=verse-num id=v46011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p><p id=p46011022_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, <b class=verse-num id=v46011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v46011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v46011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes.</p><p id=p46011026_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. <b class=verse-num id=v46011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. <b class=verse-num id=v46011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. <b class=verse-num id=v46011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. <b class=verse-num id=v46011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p><p id=p46011032_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home&#8212;so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p></div>

If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? <b class=verse-num id=v46012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. <b class=verse-num id=v46012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>If all were a single member, where would the body be? <b class=verse-num id=v46012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</p><p id=p46012020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The eye cannot say to the hand, &#8220;I have no need of you,&#8221; nor again the head to the feet, &#8220;I have no need of you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <b class=verse-num id=v46012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, <b class=verse-num id=v46012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, <b class=verse-num id=v46012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. <b class=verse-num id=v46012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</p><p id=p46012026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. <b class=verse-num id=v46012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. <b class=verse-num id=v46012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <b class=verse-num id=v46012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? <b class=verse-num id=v46012031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But earnestly desire the higher gifts.</p><p id=p46012031_08-1>And I will show you a still more excellent way.</p></div>

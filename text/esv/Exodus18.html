<h3 id=p02017001_01-1>Water from the Rock</h3><p id=p02017001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v02017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. <b class=verse-num id=v02017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, &#8220;Give us water to drink.&#8221; And Moses said to them, &#8220;Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, &#8220;Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Moses cried to the LORD, &#8220;What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. <b class=verse-num id=v02017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.&#8221; And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v02017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, &#8220;Is the LORD among us or not?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02017007_05-1>Israel Defeats Amalek</h3><p id=p02017007_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v02017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. <b class=verse-num id=v02017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Moses said to Joshua, &#8220;Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. <b class=verse-num id=v02017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed. <b class=verse-num id=v02017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Moses&#8217; hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. <b class=verse-num id=v02017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.</p><p id=p02017013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v02017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD Is My Banner, <b class=verse-num id=v02017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;A hand upon the throne of the LORD! The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.&#8221;</p></div>

The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, &#8220;I have been a sojourner in a foreign land&#8221;), <b class=verse-num id=v02018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, &#8220;The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh&#8221;). <b class=verse-num id=v02018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God. <b class=verse-num id=v02018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when he sent word to Moses, &#8220;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent. <b class=verse-num id=v02018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&#8217;s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them. <b class=verse-num id=v02018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p><p id=p02018009_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jethro said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v02018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses&#8217; father-in-law before God.</p><p id=p02018012_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening. <b class=verse-num id=v02018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Moses&#8217; father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, &#8220;What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to his father-in-law, &#8220;Because the people come to me to inquire of God; <b class=verse-num id=v02018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Moses&#8217; father-in-law said to him, &#8220;What you are doing is not good. <b class=verse-num id=v02018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone. <b class=verse-num id=v02018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God, <b class=verse-num id=v02018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do. <b class=verse-num id=v02018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. <b class=verse-num id=v02018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves.

There Israel encamped before the mountain, <b class=verse-num id=v02019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>while Moses went up to God. The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: <b class=verse-num id=v02019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8216;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&#8217; wings and brought you to myself. <b class=verse-num id=v02019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; <b class=verse-num id=v02019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8217; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him. <b class=verse-num id=v02019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>All the people answered together and said, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do.&#8221; And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019009_05-1>When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v02019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments <b class=verse-num id=v02019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. <b class=verse-num id=v02019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, &#8216;Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v02019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.&#8217; When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v02019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people, &#8220;Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. <b class=verse-num id=v02019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v02019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. <b class=verse-num id=v02019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. <b class=verse-num id=v02019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.

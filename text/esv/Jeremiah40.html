<h3 id=p24039001_01-1>The Fall of Jerusalem</h3><p id=p24039001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v24039001-1>39:1&nbsp;</b>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it. <b class=verse-num id=v24039002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. <b class=verse-num id=v24039003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar, Nebu-sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v24039004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king&#8217;s garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah. <b class=verse-num id=v24039005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him. <b class=verse-num id=v24039006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v24039007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v24039008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The Chaldeans burned the king&#8217;s house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v24039009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained. <b class=verse-num id=v24039010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p><h3 id=p24039010_05-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Delivers Jeremiah</h3><p id=p24039010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v24039011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v24039012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24039013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon <b class=verse-num id=v24039014-1>14&nbsp;</b>sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he lived among the people.</p><p id=p24039014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v24039015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard: <b class=verse-num id=v24039016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, &#8216;Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day. <b class=verse-num id=v24039017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v24039018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p24040001_01-1>Jeremiah Remains in Judah</h3><p id=p24040001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v24040001-1>40:1&nbsp;</b>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v24040002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, &#8220;The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place. <b class=verse-num id=v24040003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you. <b class=verse-num id=v24040004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. <b class=verse-num id=v24040005-1>5&nbsp;</b>If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.&#8221; So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. <b class=verse-num id=v24040006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.</p><p id=p24040006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24040007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon, <b class=verse-num id=v24040008-1>8&nbsp;</b>they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah&#8212;Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. <b class=verse-num id=v24040009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, &#8220;Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. <b class=verse-num id=v24040010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24040011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them, <b class=verse-num id=v24040012-1>12&nbsp;</b>then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.</p><p id=p24040012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24040013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah <b class=verse-num id=v24040014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?&#8221; But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them. <b class=verse-num id=v24040015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, &#8220;Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24040016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, &#8220;You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.&#8221;</p></div>

As they ate bread together there at Mizpah, <b class=verse-num id=v24041002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land. <b class=verse-num id=v24041003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.</p><p id=p24041003_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v24041004-1>4&nbsp;</b>On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it, <b class=verse-num id=v24041005-1>5&nbsp;</b>eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v24041006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, &#8220;Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24041007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern. <b class=verse-num id=v24041008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, &#8220;Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.&#8221; So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.</p><p id=p24041008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v24041009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. <b class=verse-num id=v24041010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king&#8217;s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.</p><p id=p24041010_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v24041011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, <b class=verse-num id=v24041012-1>12&nbsp;</b>they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v24041013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced. <b class=verse-num id=v24041014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. <b class=verse-num id=v24041015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v24041016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam&#8212;soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v24041017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt <b class=verse-num id=v24041018-1>18&nbsp;</b>because of the Chaldeans.

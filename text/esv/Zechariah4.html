<h3 id=p38003001_01-1>A Vision of Joshua the High Priest</h3><p id=p38003001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v38003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. <b class=verse-num id=v38003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Satan, &#8220;The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked from the fire?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v38003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments. <b class=verse-num id=v38003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the angel said to those who were standing before him, &#8220;Remove the filthy garments from him.&#8221; And to him he said, &#8220;Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with pure vestments.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v38003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8220;Let them put a clean turban on his head.&#8221; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD was standing by.</p><p id=p38003005_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v38003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured Joshua, <b class=verse-num id=v38003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here. <b class=verse-num id=v38003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. <b class=verse-num id=v38003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with seven eyes, I will engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. <b class=verse-num id=v38003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree.&#8221;</p></div>

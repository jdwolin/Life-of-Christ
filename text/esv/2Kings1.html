<h3 id=p12001001_01-1>Elijah Denounces Ahaziah</h3><p id=p12001001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.</p><p id=p12001001_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, &#8220;Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, &#8220;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, &#8216;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? <b class=verse-num id=v12001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221; So Elijah went.</p><p id=p12001004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, &#8220;Why have you returned?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;There came a man to meet us, and said to us, &#8216;Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;It is Elijah the Tishbite.&#8221;</p><p id=p12001008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &#8220;O man of God, the king says, &#8216;Come down.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, &#8220;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&#8221; Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p id=p12001010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, &#8220;O man of God, this is the king&#8217;s order, &#8216;Come down quickly!&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Elijah answered them, &#8220;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&#8221; Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p id=p12001012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, &#8220;O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight. <b class=verse-num id=v12001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, &#8220;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&#8221; So he arose and went down with him to the king <b class=verse-num id=v12001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron&#8212;is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?&#8212;therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p12001016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son. <b class=verse-num id=v12001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p></div>

And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v12002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Elisha saw it and he cried, &#8220;My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&#8221; And he saw him no more.</p><p id=p12002012_05-1>Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. <b class=verse-num id=v12002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v12002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, saying, &#8220;Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&#8221; And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.</p><h3 id=p12002014_05-1>Elisha Succeeds Elijah</h3><p id=p12002014_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them, they said, &#8220;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&#8221; And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him. <b class=verse-num id=v12002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. It may be that the Spirit of the LORD has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;You shall not send.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, &#8220;Send.&#8221; They sent therefore fifty men. And for three days they sought him but did not find him. <b class=verse-num id=v12002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they came back to him while he was staying at Jericho, and he said to them, &#8220;Did I not say to you, &#8216;Do not go&#8217;?&#8221;</p><p id=p12002018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the men of the city said to Elisha, &#8220;Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.&#8221; So they brought it to him. <b class=verse-num id=v12002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, I have healed this water; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the water has been healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.</p><p id=p12002022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He went up from there to Bethel, and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, &#8220;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys. <b class=verse-num id=v12002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</p></div>

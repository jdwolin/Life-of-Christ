<h3 id=p41014001_01-1>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h3><p id=p41014001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v41014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him, <b class=verse-num id=v41014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>for they said, &#8220;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar from the people.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p41014002_06-1>Jesus Anointed at Bethany</h3><p id=p41014002_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. <b class=verse-num id=v41014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>There were some who said to themselves indignantly, &#8220;Why was the ointment wasted like that? <b class=verse-num id=v41014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.&#8221; And they scolded her. <b class=verse-num id=v41014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41014009_10-1>Judas to Betray Jesus</h3><p id=p41014009_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. <b class=verse-num id=v41014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.</p><h3 id=p41014011_14-1>The Passover with the Disciples</h3><p id=p41014011_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, &#8220;Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, &#8216;The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</p><p id=p41014016_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. <b class=verse-num id=v41014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, &#8220;Is it I?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!

And he said to his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Sit here while I pray.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. <b class=verse-num id=v41014034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. <b class=verse-num id=v41014036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, <span class=woc>&#8220;Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. <b class=verse-num id=v41014040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. <b class=verse-num id=v41014041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And he came the third time and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41014042_32-1>Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h3><p id=p41014042_37-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. <b class=verse-num id=v41014044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &#8220;The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, &#8220;Rabbi!&#8221; And he kissed him. <b class=verse-num id=v41014046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And they laid hands on him and seized him. <b class=verse-num id=v41014047-1>47&nbsp;</b>But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. <b class=verse-num id=v41014048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41014049-1>49&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014050-1>50&nbsp;</b>And they all left him and fled.</p><h3 id=p41014050_37-1>A Young Man Flees</h3><p id=p41014050_41-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014051-1>51&nbsp;</b>And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, <b class=verse-num id=v41014052-1>52&nbsp;</b>but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.</p><h3 id=p41014052_41-1>Jesus Before the Council</h3><p id=p41014052_45-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. <b class=verse-num id=v41014054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. <b class=verse-num id=v41014055-1>55&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. <b class=verse-num id=v41014056-1>56&nbsp;</b>For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. <b class=verse-num id=v41014057-1>57&nbsp;</b>And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v41014058-1>58&nbsp;</b>&#8220;We heard him say, &#8216;I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014059-1>59&nbsp;</b>Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. <b class=verse-num id=v41014060-1>60&nbsp;</b>And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014061-1>61&nbsp;</b>But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, &#8220;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014062-1>62&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41014063-1>63&nbsp;</b>And the high priest tore his garments and said, &#8220;What further witnesses do we need? <b class=verse-num id=v41014064-1>64&nbsp;</b>You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?&#8221; And they all condemned him as deserving death. <b class=verse-num id=v41014065-1>65&nbsp;</b>And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, &#8220;Prophesy!&#8221; And the guards received him with blows.</p><h3 id=p41014065_45-1>Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id=p41014065_48-1><b class=verse-num id=v41014066-1>66&nbsp;</b>And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, <b class=verse-num id=v41014067-1>67&nbsp;</b>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, &#8220;You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014068-1>68&nbsp;</b>But he denied it, saying, &#8220;I neither know nor understand what you mean.&#8221; And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. <b class=verse-num id=v41014069-1>69&nbsp;</b>And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, &#8220;This man is one of them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014070-1>70&nbsp;</b>But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, &#8220;Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014071-1>71&nbsp;</b>But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, &#8220;I do not know this man of whom you speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41014072-1>72&nbsp;</b>And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> And he broke down and wept.</p></div>

And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. <b class=verse-num id=v41015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Pilate asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; And he answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the chief priests accused him of many things. <b class=verse-num id=v41015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Pilate again asked him, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</p><h3 id=p41015005_05-1>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</h3><p id=p41015005_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. <b class=verse-num id=v41015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. <b class=verse-num id=v41015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. <b class=verse-num id=v41015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he answered them, saying, &#8220;Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. <b class=verse-num id=v41015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. <b class=verse-num id=v41015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Pilate again said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they cried out again, &#8220;Crucify him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Pilate said to them, &#8220;Why?

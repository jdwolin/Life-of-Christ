<p id=p44022001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.&#8221;</p><p id=p44022001_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:</p><p id=p44022002_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. <b class=verse-num id=v44022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, <b class=verse-num id=v44022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.</p><p id=p44022005_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me. <b class=verse-num id=v44022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I answered, &#8216;Who are you, Lord?&#8217; And he said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me. <b class=verse-num id=v44022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8216;What shall I do, Lord?&#8217; And the Lord said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.</p><p id=p44022011_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, <b class=verse-num id=v44022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>came to me, and standing by me said to me, &#8216;Brother Saul, receive your sight.&#8217; And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him. <b class=verse-num id=v44022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8216;The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth; <b class=verse-num id=v44022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard. <b class=verse-num id=v44022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.&#8217;</p><p id=p44022016_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance <b class=verse-num id=v44022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and saw him saying to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8216;Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you. <b class=verse-num id=v44022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.&#8217;</span>&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44022021_01-1>Paul and the Roman Tribune</h3><p id=p44022021_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, &#8220;Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, <b class=verse-num id=v44022024-1>24&nbsp;</b>the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this. <b class=verse-num id=v44022025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, &#8220;Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44022026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, &#8220;What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44022027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So the tribune came and said to him, &#8220;Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>The tribune answered, &#8220;I bought this citizenship for a large sum.&#8221; Paul said, &#8220;But I am a citizen by birth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</p><h3 id=p44022029_06-1>Paul Before the Council</h3><p id=p44022029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.</p></div>

<p id=p44023001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44023001-1>23:1&nbsp;</b>And looking intently at the council, Paul said, &#8220;Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v44023003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Paul said to him, &#8220;God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Those who stood by said, &#8220;Would you revile God&#8217;s high priest?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, &#8216;You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p44023005_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, &#8220;Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. <b class=verse-num id=v44023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. <b class=verse-num id=v44023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees&#8217; party stood up and contended sharply, &#8220;We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</p><p id=p44023010_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The following night the Lord stood by him and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p44023011_01-1>A Plot to Kill Paul</h3><p id=p44023011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. <b class=verse-num id=v44023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, &#8220;We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.&#8221;</p><p id=p44023015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the son of Paul&#8217;s sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Paul called one of the centurions and said, &#8220;Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, &#8220;Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, &#8220;What is it that you have to tell me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. <b class=verse-num id=v44023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, &#8220;Tell no one that you have informed me of these things.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44023022_06-1>Paul Sent to Felix the Governor</h3><p id=p44023022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then he called two of the centurions and said, &#8220;Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night. <b class=verse-num id=v44023024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he wrote a letter to this effect:</p><p id=p44023025_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings. <b class=verse-num id=v44023027-1>27&nbsp;</b>This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen. <b class=verse-num id=v44023028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council. <b class=verse-num id=v44023029-1>29&nbsp;</b>I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment. <b class=verse-num id=v44023030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44023030_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. <b class=verse-num id=v44023032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44023033-1>33&nbsp;</b>When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. <b class=verse-num id=v44023034-1>34&nbsp;</b>On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia, <b class=verse-num id=v44023035-1>35&nbsp;</b>he said, &#8220;I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.&#8221; And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod&#8217;s praetorium.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44024001_01-1>Paul Before Felix at Caesarea</h3><p id=p44024001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:</p><p id=p44024002_06-1>&#8220;Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation, <b class=verse-num id=v44024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. <b class=verse-num id=v44024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. <b class=verse-num id=v44024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. <b class=verse-num id=v44024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. <b class=verse-num id=v44024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44024008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.</p><p id=p44024009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:</p><p id=p44024010_06-1>&#8220;Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. <b class=verse-num id=v44024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v44024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city. <b class=verse-num id=v44024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. <b class=verse-num id=v44024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, <b class=verse-num id=v44024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. <b class=verse-num id=v44024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man. <b class=verse-num id=v44024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v44024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v44024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me. <b class=verse-num id=v44024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, <b class=verse-num id=v44024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: &#8216;It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44024021_06-1>Paul Kept in Custody</h3><p id=p44024021_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, &#8220;When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.</p><p id=p44024023_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44024024-1>24&nbsp;</b>After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, &#8220;Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44024026-1>26&nbsp;</b>At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</p></div>

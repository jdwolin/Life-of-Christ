<h3 id=p12017001_01-1>Hoshea Reigns in Israel</h3><p id=p12017001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, and he reigned nine years. <b class=verse-num id=v12017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v12017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria. And Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. <b class=verse-num id=v12017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison. <b class=verse-num id=v12017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria, and for three years he besieged it.</p><h3 id=p12017005_05-1>The Fall of Israel</h3><p id=p12017005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p><h3 id=p12017006_09-1>Exile Because of Idolatry</h3><p id=p12017006_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And this occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods <b class=verse-num id=v12017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had practiced. <b class=verse-num id=v12017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did secretly against the LORD their God things that were not right. They built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city. <b class=verse-num id=v12017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, <b class=verse-num id=v12017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. And they did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger, <b class=verse-num id=v12017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, &#8220;You shall not do this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, &#8220;Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the Law that I commanded your fathers, and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.&#8221;</p><p id=p12017013_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in the LORD their God. <b class=verse-num id=v12017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They despised his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and the warnings that he gave them. They went after false idols and became false, and they followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should not do like them. <b class=verse-num id=v12017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves metal images of two calves; and they made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal. <b class=verse-num id=v12017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings and used divination and omens and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v12017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. None was left but the tribe of Judah only.</p><p id=p12017018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. <b class=verse-num id=v12017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</p><p id=p12017020_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When he had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD and made them commit great sin. <b class=verse-num id=v12017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel walked in all the sins that Jeroboam did. They did not depart from them, <b class=verse-num id=v12017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had spoken by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day.</p><h3 id=p12017023_13-1>Assyria Resettles Samaria</h3><p id=p12017023_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel. And they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. <b class=verse-num id=v12017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD. Therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them. <b class=verse-num id=v12017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So the king of Assyria was told, &#8220;The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Assyria commanded, &#8220;Send there one of the priests whom you carried away from there, and let him go and dwell there and teach them the law of the god of the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</p><p id=p12017028_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities in which they lived. <b class=verse-num id=v12017030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, <b class=verse-num id=v12017031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. <b class=verse-num id=v12017032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places. <b class=verse-num id=v12017033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they feared the LORD but also served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</p><p id=p12017033_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017034-1>34&nbsp;</b>To this day they do according to the former manner. They do not fear the LORD, and they do not follow the statutes or the rules or the law or the commandment that the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12017035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The LORD made a covenant with them and commanded them, &#8220;You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them, <b class=verse-num id=v12017036-1>36&nbsp;</b>but you shall fear the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm. You shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v12017037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And the statutes and the rules and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods, <b class=verse-num id=v12017038-1>38&nbsp;</b>and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods, <b class=verse-num id=v12017039-1>39&nbsp;</b>but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017040-1>40&nbsp;</b>However, they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.</p><p id=p12017040_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So these nations feared the LORD and also served their carved images. Their children did likewise, and their children&#8217;s children&#8212;as their fathers did, so they do to this day.</p></div>

His mother&#8217;s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. <b class=verse-num id=v12018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. <b class=verse-num id=v12018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>He removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan). <b class=verse-num id=v12018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v12018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For he held fast to the LORD. He did not depart from following him, but kept the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v12018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the LORD was with him; wherever he went out, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him. <b class=verse-num id=v12018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He struck down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.</p><p id=p12018008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it, <b class=verse-num id=v12018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and at the end of three years he took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. <b class=verse-num id=v12018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The king of Assyria carried the Israelites away to Assyria and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, <b class=verse-num id=v12018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened nor obeyed.</p><h3 id=p12018012_05-1>Sennacherib Attacks Judah</h3><p id=p12018012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. <b class=verse-num id=v12018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, &#8220;I have done wrong; withdraw from me. Whatever you impose on me I will bear.&#8221; And the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. <b class=verse-num id=v12018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v12018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the doorposts that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria. <b class=verse-num id=v12018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer&#8217;s Field. <b class=verse-num id=v12018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when they called for the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.</p><p id=p12018018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Say to Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours? <b class=verse-num id=v12018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me? <b class=verse-num id=v12018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Behold, you are trusting now in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. <b class=verse-num id=v12018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But if you say to me, &#8220;We trust in the LORD our God,&#8221; is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, &#8220;You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v12018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. <b class=verse-num id=v12018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master&#8217;s servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <b class=verse-num id=v12018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, &#8220;Go up against this land and destroy it.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p12018025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But the Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink their own urine?&#8221;</p><p id=p12018027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: &#8220;Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! <b class=verse-num id=v12018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Thus says the king: &#8216;Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand. <b class=verse-num id=v12018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v12018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: &#8216;Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern, <b class=verse-num id=v12018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live, and not die. And do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, &#8220;The LORD will deliver us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <b class=verse-num id=v12018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v12018035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p12018035_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018036-1>36&nbsp;</b>But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king&#8217;s command was, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12018037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.</p></div>

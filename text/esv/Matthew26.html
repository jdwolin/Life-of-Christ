Come out to meet him.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the foolish said to the wise, &#8216;Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But the wise answered, saying, &#8216;Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, &#8216;Lord, lord, open to us.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But he answered, &#8216;Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.</span></p><h3 id=p40025013_07-1>The Parable of the Talents</h3><p id=p40025013_12-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40025014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master&#8217;s money.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, &#8216;Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>His master said to him, &#8216;Well done, good and faithful servant.

Here, you have what is yours.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But his master answered him, &#8216;You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40025029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance.

And the high priest said to him, &#8220;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026064-1>64&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40026065-1>65&nbsp;</b>Then the high priest tore his robes and said, &#8220;He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. <b class=verse-num id=v40026066-1>66&nbsp;</b>What is your judgment?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;He deserves death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026067-1>67&nbsp;</b>Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, <b class=verse-num id=v40026068-1>68&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40026068_43-1>Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id=p40026068_46-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026069-1>69&nbsp;</b>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, &#8220;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026070-1>70&nbsp;</b>But he denied it before them all, saying, &#8220;I do not know what you mean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026071-1>71&nbsp;</b>And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, &#8220;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026072-1>72&nbsp;</b>And again he denied it with an oath: &#8220;I do not know the man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026073-1>73&nbsp;</b>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, &#8220;Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026074-1>74&nbsp;</b>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, &#8220;I do not know the man.&#8221; And immediately the rooster crowed. <b class=verse-num id=v40026075-1>75&nbsp;</b>And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, <span class=woc>&#8220;Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> And he went out and wept bitterly.</p></div>

See to it yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. <b class=verse-num id=v40027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, &#8220;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field as a burial place for strangers. <b class=verse-num id=v40027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v40027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, &#8220;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v40027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and they gave them for the potter&#8217;s field, as the Lord directed me.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40027010_08-1>Jesus Before Pilate</h3><p id=p40027010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. <b class=verse-num id=v40027013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p><h3 id=p40027014_11-1>The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</h3><p id=p40027014_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. <b class=verse-num id=v40027016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. <b class=verse-num id=v40027017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, &#8220;Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. <b class=verse-num id=v40027019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, &#8220;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v40027021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The governor again said to them, &#8220;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Barabbas.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; They all said, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Why?

If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v40027042-1>42&nbsp;</b>&#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself.

And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, <b class=verse-num id=v40027053-1>53&nbsp;</b>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. <b class=verse-num id=v40027054-1>54&nbsp;</b>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221;</p><p id=p40027054_30-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027055-1>55&nbsp;</b>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, <b class=verse-num id=v40027056-1>56&nbsp;</b>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p><h3 id=p40027056_30-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p40027056_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027057-1>57&nbsp;</b>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v40027058-1>58&nbsp;</b>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <b class=verse-num id=v40027059-1>59&nbsp;</b>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud <b class=verse-num id=v40027060-1>60&nbsp;</b>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock.

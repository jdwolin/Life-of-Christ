<h3 id=p41005001_01-1>Jesus Heals a Man with a Demon</h3><p id=p41005001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v41005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. <b class=verse-num id=v41005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v41005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, <b class=verse-num id=v41005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. <b class=verse-num id=v41005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. <b class=verse-num id=v41005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. <b class=verse-num id=v41005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And crying out with a loud voice, he said, &#8220;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For he was saying to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jesus asked him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span> He replied, &#8220;My name is Legion, for we are many.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. <b class=verse-num id=v41005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, <b class=verse-num id=v41005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and they begged him, saying, &#8220;Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea.</p><p id=p41005013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v41005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v41005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v41005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs. <b class=verse-num id=v41005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. <b class=verse-num id=v41005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. <b class=verse-num id=v41005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he did not permit him but said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.</p><h3 id=p41005020_08-1>Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus&#8217;s Daughter</h3><p id=p41005020_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v41005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea. <b class=verse-num id=v41005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet <b class=verse-num id=v41005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and implored him earnestly, saying, &#8220;My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he went with him.</p><p id=p41005024_15-1>And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. <b class=verse-num id=v41005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, <b class=verse-num id=v41005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. <b class=verse-num id=v41005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. <b class=verse-num id=v41005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For she said, &#8220;If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. <b class=verse-num id=v41005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Who touched my garments?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And his disciples said to him, &#8220;You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, <span class=woc>&#8216;Who touched me?&#8217;</span>&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And he looked around to see who had done it. <b class=verse-num id=v41005033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. <b class=verse-num id=v41005034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p41005034_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v41005035-1>35&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler&#8217;s house some who said, &#8220;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41005036-1>36&nbsp;</b>But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not fear, only believe.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41005037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. <b class=verse-num id=v41005038-1>38&nbsp;</b>They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. <b class=verse-num id=v41005039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And when he had entered, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41005040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child&#8217;s father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was. <b class=verse-num id=v41005041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Taking her by the hand he said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Talitha cumi,&#8221;</span> which means, <span class=woc>&#8220;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41005042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. <b class=verse-num id=v41005043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p></div>

What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? <b class=verse-num id=v41006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?&#8221; And they took offense at him. <b class=verse-num id=v41006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. <b class=verse-num id=v41006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he marveled because of their unbelief.</p><p id=p41006006_05-1>And he went about among the villages teaching.</p><h3 id=p41006006_05-1>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles</h3><p id=p41006006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v41006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. <b class=verse-num id=v41006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff&#8212;no bread, no bag, no money in their belts&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v41006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. <b class=verse-num id=v41006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41006011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. <b class=verse-num id=v41006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.</p><h3 id=p41006013_11-1>The Death of John the Baptist</h3><p id=p41006013_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v41006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>King Herod heard of it, for Jesus&#8217; name had become known. Some said, &#8220;John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But others said, &#8220;He is Elijah.&#8221; And others said, &#8220;He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when Herod heard of it, he said, &#8220;John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, because he had married her. <b class=verse-num id=v41006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For John had been saying to Herod, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#8217;s wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, <b class=verse-num id=v41006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.</p><p id=p41006020_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v41006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. <b class=verse-num id=v41006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For when Herodias&#8217;s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, &#8220;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he vowed to her, &#8220;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And she went out and said to her mother, &#8220;For what should I ask?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;The head of John the Baptist.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, &#8220;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. <b class=verse-num id=v41006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John&#8217;s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison <b class=verse-num id=v41006028-1>28&nbsp;</b>and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. <b class=verse-num id=v41006029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</p><h3 id=p41006029_17-1>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h3><p id=p41006029_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v41006030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. <b class=verse-num id=v41006031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.&#8221;</span> For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. <b class=verse-num id=v41006032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v41006033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <b class=verse-num id=v41006034-1>34&nbsp;</b>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. <b class=verse-num id=v41006035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, &#8220;This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. <b class=verse-num id=v41006036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;How many loaves do you have? Go and see.&#8221;</span> And when they had found out, they said, &#8220;Five, and two fish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41006039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. <b class=verse-num id=v41006040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. <b class=verse-num id=v41006041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. <b class=verse-num id=v41006042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And they all ate and were satisfied. <b class=verse-num id=v41006043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. <b class=verse-num id=v41006044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</p><h3 id=p41006044_22-1>Jesus Walks on the Water</h3><p id=p41006044_27-1><b class=verse-num id=v41006045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v41006046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. <b class=verse-num id=v41006047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. <b class=verse-num id=v41006048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, <b class=verse-num id=v41006049-1>49&nbsp;</b>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, <b class=verse-num id=v41006050-1>50&nbsp;</b>for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41006051-1>51&nbsp;</b>And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, <b class=verse-num id=v41006052-1>52&nbsp;</b>for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</p><h3 id=p41006052_27-1>Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret</h3><p id=p41006052_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v41006053-1>53&nbsp;</b>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. <b class=verse-num id=v41006054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him <b class=verse-num id=v41006055-1>55&nbsp;</b>and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. <b class=verse-num id=v41006056-1>56&nbsp;</b>And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment.

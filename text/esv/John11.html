The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p><p id=p43010006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Jesus again said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43010018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. <b class=verse-num id=v43010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Many of them said, &#8220;He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Others said, &#8220;These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon.

If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>After saying these things, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, &#8220;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. <b class=verse-num id=v43011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus told them plainly, <span class=woc>&#8220;Lazarus has died,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe.

It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <b class=verse-num id=v43011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221;</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &#8220;Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011043-1>43&nbsp;</b>When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <span class=woc>&#8220;Lazarus, come out.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Unbind him, and let him go.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43011044_17-1>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h3><p id=p43011044_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him, <b class=verse-num id=v43011046-1>46&nbsp;</b>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <b class=verse-num id=v43011047-1>47&nbsp;</b>So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, &#8220;What are we to do?

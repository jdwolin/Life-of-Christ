<h3 id=p17003001_01-1>Haman Plots Against the Jews</h3><p id=p17003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v17003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And all the king&#8217;s servants who were at the king&#8217;s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage. <b class=verse-num id=v17003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the king&#8217;s servants who were at the king&#8217;s gate said to Mordecai, &#8220;Why do you transgress the king&#8217;s command?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai&#8217;s words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew. <b class=verse-num id=v17003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury. <b class=verse-num id=v17003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.</p><p id=p17003006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v17003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. <b class=verse-num id=v17003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, &#8220;There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king&#8217;s laws, so that it is not to the king&#8217;s profit to tolerate them. <b class=verse-num id=v17003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king&#8217;s business, that they may put it into the king&#8217;s treasuries.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the king said to Haman, &#8220;The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.&#8221;</p><p id=p17003011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v17003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the king&#8217;s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king&#8217;s satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king&#8217;s signet ring. <b class=verse-num id=v17003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Letters were sent by couriers to all the king&#8217;s provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. <b class=verse-num id=v17003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day. <b class=verse-num id=v17003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.</p></div>

She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. <b class=verse-num id=v17004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was. <b class=verse-num id=v17004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king&#8217;s gate, <b class=verse-num id=v17004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king&#8217;s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people. <b class=verse-num id=v17004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. <b class=verse-num id=v17004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say, <b class=verse-num id=v17004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;All the king&#8217;s servants and the people of the king&#8217;s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law&#8212;to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.&#8221;</p><p id=p17004011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v17004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. <b class=verse-num id=v17004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, &#8220;Do not think to yourself that in the king&#8217;s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&#8217;s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, <b class=verse-num id=v17004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.</p></div>

Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. <b class=verse-num id=v17005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Esther said, &#8220;If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the king said, &#8220;Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked.&#8221; So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared. <b class=verse-num id=v17005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Esther answered, &#8220;My wish and my request is: <b class=verse-num id=v17005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p17005008_05-1>Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai</h3><p id=p17005008_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v17005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#8217;s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. <b class=verse-num id=v17005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh. <b class=verse-num id=v17005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Haman said, &#8220;Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#8217;s gate.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#8220;Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast.&#8221; This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.</p></div>

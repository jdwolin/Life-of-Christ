<h3 id=p27009001_01-1>Daniel&#8217;s Prayer for His People</h3><p id=p27009001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v27009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.</p><p id=p27009002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. <b class=verse-num id=v27009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, &#8220;O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, <b class=verse-num id=v27009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules. <b class=verse-num id=v27009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v27009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you. <b class=verse-num id=v27009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>To us, O LORD, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you. <b class=verse-num id=v27009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him <b class=verse-num id=v27009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v27009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. And the curse and oath that are written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him. <b class=verse-num id=v27009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v27009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the LORD our God, turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth. <b class=verse-num id=v27009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works that he has done, and we have not obeyed his voice. <b class=verse-num id=v27009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</p><p id=p27009015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;O Lord, according to all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy hill, because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all who are around us. <b class=verse-num id=v27009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate. <b class=verse-num id=v27009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy. <b class=verse-num id=v27009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p27009019_06-1>Gabriel Brings an Answer</h3><p id=p27009019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God, <b class=verse-num id=v27009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v27009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, &#8220;O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. <b class=verse-num id=v27009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.</p><h3 id=p27009023_10-1>The Seventy Weeks</h3><p id=p27009023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. <b class=verse-num id=v27009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. <b class=verse-num id=v27009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. <b class=verse-num id=v27009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p27010001_01-1>Daniel&#8217;s Terrifying Vision of a Man</h3><p id=p27010001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.</p><p id=p27010001_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. <b class=verse-num id=v27010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. <b class=verse-num id=v27010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris) <b class=verse-num id=v27010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. <b class=verse-num id=v27010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v27010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v27010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength. <b class=verse-num id=v27010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.</p><p id=p27010009_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. <b class=verse-num id=v27010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.&#8221; And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. <b class=verse-num id=v27010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words. <b class=verse-num id=v27010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, <b class=verse-num id=v27010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.&#8221;</p><p id=p27010014_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute. <b class=verse-num id=v27010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And behold, one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &#8220;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. <b class=verse-num id=v27010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>How can my lord&#8217;s servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.&#8221;</p><p id=p27010017_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. <b class=verse-num id=v27010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&#8221; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &#8220;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. <b class=verse-num id=v27010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.</p></div>

<h3 id=p27011001_01-1>The Kings of the South and the North</h3><p id=p27011001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.</p><p id=p27011001_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings shall arise in Persia, and a fourth shall be far richer than all of them. And when he has become strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece. <b class=verse-num id=v27011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and do as he wills. <b class=verse-num id=v27011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to the authority with which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to others besides these.</p><p id=p27011004_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes shall be stronger than he and shall rule, and his authority shall be a great authority. <b class=verse-num id=v27011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>After some years they shall make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the strength of her arm, and he and his arm shall not endure, but she shall be given up, and her attendants, he who fathered her, and he who supported her in those times.</p><p id=p27011006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And from a branch from her roots one shall arise in his place. He shall come against the army and enter the fortress of the king of the north, and he shall deal with them and shall prevail. <b class=verse-num id=v27011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold, and for some years he shall refrain from attacking the king of the north. <b class=verse-num id=v27011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the latter shall come into the realm of the king of the south but shall return to his own land.</p><p id=p27011009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall keep coming and overflow and pass through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress. <b class=verse-num id=v27011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the king of the south, moved with rage, shall come out and fight against the king of the north. And he shall raise a great multitude, but it shall be given into his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v27011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when the multitude is taken away, his heart shall be exalted, and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail. <b class=verse-num id=v27011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the king of the north shall again raise a multitude, greater than the first. And after some years he shall come on with a great army and abundant supplies.</p><p id=p27011013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;In those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the violent among your own people shall lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail. <b class=verse-num id=v27011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the king of the north shall come and throw up siegeworks and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, or even his best troops, for there shall be no strength to stand. <b class=verse-num id=v27011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But he who comes against him shall do as he wills, and none shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v27011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and he shall bring terms of an agreement and perform them.

But within a few days he shall be broken, neither in anger nor in battle. <b class=verse-num id=v27011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In his place shall arise a contemptible person to whom royal majesty has not been given. He shall come in without warning and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. <b class=verse-num id=v27011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Armies shall be utterly swept away before him and broken, even the prince of the covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v27011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And from the time that an alliance is made with him he shall act deceitfully, and he shall become strong with a small people. <b class=verse-num id=v27011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Without warning he shall come into the richest parts of the province, and he shall do what neither his fathers nor his fathers&#8217; fathers have done, scattering among them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against strongholds, but only for a time. <b class=verse-num id=v27011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he shall stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall wage war with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for plots shall be devised against him. <b class=verse-num id=v27011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Even those who eat his food shall break him. His army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain. <b class=verse-num id=v27011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And as for the two kings, their hearts shall be bent on doing evil. They shall speak lies at the same table, but to no avail, for the end is yet to be at the time appointed. <b class=verse-num id=v27011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he shall return to his land with great wealth, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And he shall work his will and return to his own land.</p><p id=p27011028_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&#8220;At the time appointed he shall return and come into the south, but it shall not be this time as it was before. <b class=verse-num id=v27011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v27011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the regular burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate. <b class=verse-num id=v27011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He shall seduce with flattery those who violate the covenant, but the people who know their God shall stand firm and take action. <b class=verse-num id=v27011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the wise among the people shall make many understand, though for some days they shall stumble by sword and flame, by captivity and plunder. <b class=verse-num id=v27011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>When they stumble, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join themselves to them with flattery, <b class=verse-num id=v27011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>and some of the wise shall stumble, so that they may be refined, purified, and made white, until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time.</p><p id=p27011035_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011036-1>36&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And the king shall do as he wills. He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He shall prosper till the indignation is accomplished; for what is decreed shall be done. <b class=verse-num id=v27011037-1>37&nbsp;</b>He shall pay no attention to the gods of his fathers, or to the one beloved by women. He shall not pay attention to any other god, for he shall magnify himself above all. <b class=verse-num id=v27011038-1>38&nbsp;</b>He shall honor the god of fortresses instead of these. A god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. <b class=verse-num id=v27011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>He shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. Those who acknowledge him he shall load with honor. He shall make them rulers over many and shall divide the land for a price.</p><p id=p27011039_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27011040-1>40&nbsp;</b>&#8220;At the time of the end, the king of the south shall attack him, but the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind, with chariots and horsemen, and with many ships. And he shall come into countries and shall overflow and pass through. <b class=verse-num id=v27011041-1>41&nbsp;</b>He shall come into the glorious land. And tens of thousands shall fall, but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v27011042-1>42&nbsp;</b>He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape. <b class=verse-num id=v27011043-1>43&nbsp;</b>He shall become ruler of the treasures of gold and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt, and the Libyans and the Cushites shall follow in his train. <b class=verse-num id=v27011044-1>44&nbsp;</b>But news from the east and the north shall alarm him, and he shall go out with great fury to destroy and devote many to destruction. <b class=verse-num id=v27011045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And he shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the glorious holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with none to help him.</p></div>

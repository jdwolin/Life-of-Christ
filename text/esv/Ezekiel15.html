Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them? <b class=verse-num id=v26014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols, <b class=verse-num id=v26014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.</p><p id=p26014005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the LORD will answer him myself. <b class=verse-num id=v26014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they shall bear their punishment&#8212;the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v26014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26014011_04-1>Jerusalem Will Not Be Spared</h3><p id=p26014011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast, <b class=verse-num id=v26014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26014014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts, <b class=verse-num id=v26014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>even if these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters.

The like has never been, nor ever shall be. <b class=verse-num id=v26016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore. <b class=verse-num id=v26016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them. <b class=verse-num id=v26016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Also my bread that I gave you&#8212;I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey&#8212;you set before them for a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured.

Yet you were not like a prostitute, because you scorned payment. <b class=verse-num id=v26016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! <b class=verse-num id=v26016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings. <b class=verse-num id=v26016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different.</p><p id=p26016034_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD: <b class=verse-num id=v26016036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them, <b class=verse-num id=v26016037-1>37&nbsp;</b>therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. <b class=verse-num id=v26016038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy. <b class=verse-num id=v26016039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare. <b class=verse-num id=v26016040-1>40&nbsp;</b>They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. <b class=verse-num id=v26016041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. I will make you stop playing the whore, and you shall also give payment no more. <b class=verse-num id=v26016042-1>42&nbsp;</b>So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry. <b class=verse-num id=v26016043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord GOD.

Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <b class=verse-num id=v26016046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. <b class=verse-num id=v26016047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. <b class=verse-num id=v26016048-1>48&nbsp;</b>As I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done. <b class=verse-num id=v26016049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. <b class=verse-num id=v26016050-1>50&nbsp;</b>They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it. <b class=verse-num id=v26016051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed. <b class=verse-num id=v26016052-1>52&nbsp;</b>Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you.

Now you have become an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you. <b class=verse-num id=v26016058-1>58&nbsp;</b>You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.</p><h3 id=p26016058_05-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span>&#8217;s Everlasting Covenant</h3><p id=p26016058_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26016059-1>59&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant, <b class=verse-num id=v26016060-1>60&nbsp;</b>yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v26016061-1>61&nbsp;</b>Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you. <b class=verse-num id=v26016062-1>62&nbsp;</b>I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v26016063-1>63&nbsp;</b>that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p></div>

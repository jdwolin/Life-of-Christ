<h3 id=p47010001_01-1>Paul Defends His Ministry</h3><p id=p47010001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ&#8212;I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v47010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v47010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v47010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. <b class=verse-num id=v47010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v47010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.</p><p id=p47010006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v47010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Look at what is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ&#8217;s, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ&#8217;s, so also are we. <b class=verse-num id=v47010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed. <b class=verse-num id=v47010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters. <b class=verse-num id=v47010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For they say, &#8220;His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v47010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. <b class=verse-num id=v47010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Not that we dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.</p><p id=p47010012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v47010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even to you. <b class=verse-num id=v47010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others. But our hope is that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged, <b class=verse-num id=v47010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another&#8217;s area of influence. <b class=verse-num id=v47010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v47010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</p></div>

<h3 id=p47011001_01-1>Paul and the False Apostles</h3><p id=p47011001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me! <b class=verse-num id=v47011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. <b class=verse-num id=v47011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. <b class=verse-num id=v47011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</p><p id=p47011006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God&#8217;s gospel to you free of charge? <b class=verse-num id=v47011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. <b class=verse-num id=v47011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. <b class=verse-num id=v47011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. <b class=verse-num id=v47011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p><p id=p47011011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. <b class=verse-num id=v47011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. <b class=verse-num id=v47011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.</p><h3 id=p47011015_06-1>Paul&#8217;s Sufferings as an Apostle</h3><p id=p47011015_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. <b class=verse-num id=v47011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not as the Lord would but as a fool. <b class=verse-num id=v47011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. <b class=verse-num id=v47011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! <b class=verse-num id=v47011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. <b class=verse-num id=v47011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!</p><p id=p47011021_11-1>But whatever anyone else dares to boast of&#8212;I am speaking as a fool&#8212;I also dare to boast of that. <b class=verse-num id=v47011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. <b class=verse-num id=v47011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one&#8212;I am talking like a madman&#8212;with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. <b class=verse-num id=v47011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. <b class=verse-num id=v47011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; <b class=verse-num id=v47011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v47011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. <b class=verse-num id=v47011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. <b class=verse-num id=v47011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?</p><p id=p47011029_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. <b class=verse-num id=v47011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. <b class=verse-num id=v47011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, <b class=verse-num id=v47011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.</p></div>

<h3 id=p47012001_01-1>Paul&#8217;s Visions and His Thorn</h3><p id=p47012001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v47012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. <b class=verse-num id=v47012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And I know that this man was caught up into paradise&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v47012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. <b class=verse-num id=v47012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v47012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. <b class=verse-num id=v47012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. <b class=verse-num id=v47012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. <b class=verse-num id=v47012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But he said to me, <span class=woc>&#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;</span> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. <b class=verse-num id=v47012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</p><h3 id=p47012010_06-1>Concern for the Corinthian Church</h3><p id=p47012010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v47012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works. <b class=verse-num id=v47012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!</p><p id=p47012013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for I seek not what is yours but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. <b class=verse-num id=v47012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? <b class=verse-num id=v47012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by deceit. <b class=verse-num id=v47012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? <b class=verse-num id=v47012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?</p><p id=p47012018_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved. <b class=verse-num id=v47012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish&#8212;that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. <b class=verse-num id=v47012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.</p></div>

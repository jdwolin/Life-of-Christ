<h3 id=p61001001_01-1>Greeting</h3><p id=p61001001_02-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v61001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,</p><p id=p61001001_02-1>To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:</p><p id=p61001001_02-1><b class=verse-num id=v61001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p><h3 id=p61001002_02-1>Confirm Your Calling and Election</h3><p id=p61001002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v61001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, <b class=verse-num id=v61001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. <b class=verse-num id=v61001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, <b class=verse-num id=v61001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, <b class=verse-num id=v61001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. <b class=verse-num id=v61001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v61001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. <b class=verse-num id=v61001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. <b class=verse-num id=v61001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p><p id=p61001011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v61001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have. <b class=verse-num id=v61001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder, <b class=verse-num id=v61001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. <b class=verse-num id=v61001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.</p><h3 id=p61001015_07-1>Christ&#8217;s Glory and the Prophetic Word</h3><p id=p61001015_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v61001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. <b class=verse-num id=v61001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v61001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v61001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, <b class=verse-num id=v61001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone&#8217;s own interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v61001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</p></div>

<h3 id=p61002001_01-1>False Prophets and Teachers</h3><p id=p61002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v61002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. <b class=verse-num id=v61002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed. <b class=verse-num id=v61002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.</p><p id=p61002003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v61002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; <b class=verse-num id=v61002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; <b class=verse-num id=v61002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; <b class=verse-num id=v61002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked <b class=verse-num id=v61002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>(for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard); <b class=verse-num id=v61002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, <b class=verse-num id=v61002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority.</p><p id=p61002010_05-1>Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones, <b class=verse-num id=v61002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v61002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction, <b class=verse-num id=v61002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you. <b class=verse-num id=v61002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! <b class=verse-num id=v61002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing, <b class=verse-num id=v61002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet&#8217;s madness.</p><p id=p61002016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v61002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved. <b class=verse-num id=v61002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For, speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error. <b class=verse-num id=v61002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. <b class=verse-num id=v61002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. <b class=verse-num id=v61002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. <b class=verse-num id=v61002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What the true proverb says has happened to them: &#8220;The dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.&#8221;</p></div>

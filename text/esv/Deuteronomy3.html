<h3 id=p05002001_01-1>The Wilderness Years</h3><p id=p05002001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir. <b class=verse-num id=v05002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to me, <b class=verse-num id=v05002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8216;You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward <b class=verse-num id=v05002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and command the people, &#8220;You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful. <b class=verse-num id=v05002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. <b class=verse-num id=v05002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink. <b class=verse-num id=v05002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.</p><p id=p05002008_04-1>&#8220;And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab. <b class=verse-num id=v05002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim. <b class=verse-num id=v05002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. <b class=verse-num id=v05002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.) <b class=verse-num id=v05002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.&#8217; So we went over the brook Zered. <b class=verse-num id=v05002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. <b class=verse-num id=v05002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.</p><p id=p05002015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people, <b class=verse-num id=v05002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>the LORD said to me, <b class=verse-num id=v05002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar. <b class=verse-num id=v05002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>(It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there&#8212;but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place, <b class=verse-num id=v05002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v05002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.) <b class=verse-num id=v05002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle. <b class=verse-num id=v05002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p05002025_04-1>The Defeat of King Sihon</h3><p id=p05002025_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v05002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v05002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left. <b class=verse-num id=v05002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot, <b class=verse-num id=v05002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day. <b class=verse-num id=v05002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. <b class=verse-num id=v05002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the LORD our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people. <b class=verse-num id=v05002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors. <b class=verse-num id=v05002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured. <b class=verse-num id=v05002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God gave all into our hands. <b class=verse-num id=v05002037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us.</p></div>

<h3 id=p05003001_01-1>The Defeat of King Og</h3><p id=p05003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <b class=verse-num id=v05003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to me, &#8216;Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left. <b class=verse-num id=v05003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And we took all his cities at that time&#8212;there was not a city that we did not take from them&#8212;sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <b class=verse-num id=v05003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages. <b class=verse-num id=v05003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And we devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children. <b class=verse-num id=v05003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder. <b class=verse-num id=v05003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon <b class=verse-num id=v05003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir), <b class=verse-num id=v05003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <b class=verse-num id=v05003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.)</p><p id=p05003011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v05003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities. <b class=verse-num id=v05003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v05003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.) <b class=verse-num id=v05003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>To Machir I gave Gilead, <b class=verse-num id=v05003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites; <b class=verse-num id=v05003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.</p><p id=p05003017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v05003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And I commanded you at that time, saying, &#8216;The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v05003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you, <b class=verse-num id=v05003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And I commanded Joshua at that time, &#8216;Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing. <b class=verse-num id=v05003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p05003022_06-1>Moses Forbidden to Enter the Land</h3><p id=p05003022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v05003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v05003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8216;O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours? <b class=verse-num id=v05003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again. <b class=verse-num id=v05003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v05003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.</p></div>

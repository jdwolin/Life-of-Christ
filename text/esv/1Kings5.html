They ate and drank and were happy. <b class=verse-num id=v11004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p><p id=p11004021_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v11004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Solomon&#8217;s provision for one day was thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal, <b class=verse-num id=v11004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle, a hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. <b class=verse-num id=v11004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates.

<h3 id=p11005001_01-1>Preparations for Building the Temple</h3><p id=p11005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. <b class=verse-num id=v11005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Solomon sent word to Hiram, <b class=verse-num id=v11005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. <b class=verse-num id=v11005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune. <b class=verse-num id=v11005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, &#8216;Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.&#8221;</p><p id=p11005006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v11005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, &#8220;I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. <b class=verse-num id=v11005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, <b class=verse-num id=v11005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. <b class=verse-num id=v11005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.</p><p id=p11005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v11005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men. <b class=verse-num id=v11005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft. <b class=verse-num id=v11005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, <b class=verse-num id=v11005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>besides Solomon&#8217;s 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. <b class=verse-num id=v11005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>At the king&#8217;s command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. <b class=verse-num id=v11005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So Solomon&#8217;s builders and Hiram&#8217;s builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.</p></div>

And he made side chambers all around. <b class=verse-num id=v11006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.</p><p id=p11006006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.</p><p id=p11006007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third. <b class=verse-num id=v11006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar. <b class=verse-num id=v11006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.</p><p id=p11006010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon, <b class=verse-num id=v11006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. <b class=verse-num id=v11006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p11006013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Solomon built the house and finished it. <b class=verse-num id=v11006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. <b class=verse-num id=v11006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place. <b class=verse-num id=v11006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. <b class=verse-num id=v11006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen. <b class=verse-num id=v11006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v11006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid an altar of cedar. <b class=verse-num id=v11006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. <b class=verse-num id=v11006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished.

The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. <b class=verse-num id=v11006035-1>35&nbsp;</b>On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. <b class=verse-num id=v11006036-1>36&nbsp;</b>He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.</p><p id=p11006036_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006037-1>37&nbsp;</b>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv. <b class=verse-num id=v11006038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications.

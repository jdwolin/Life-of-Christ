That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. <b class=verse-num id=v32004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v32004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said, &#8220;Do you do well to be angry?&#8221;</p><p id=p32004004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v32004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. <b class=verse-num id=v32004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort.

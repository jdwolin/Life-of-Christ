<h3 id=p45013001_01-1>Submission to the Authorities</h3><p id=p45013001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. <b class=verse-num id=v45013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v45013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, <b class=verse-num id=v45013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for he is God&#8217;s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God&#8217;s wrath on the wrongdoer. <b class=verse-num id=v45013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God&#8217;s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v45013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. <b class=verse-num id=v45013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</p><h3 id=p45013007_05-1>Fulfilling the Law Through Love</h3><p id=p45013007_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For the commandments, &#8220;You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,&#8221; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</p><p id=p45013010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. <b class=verse-num id=v45013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. <b class=verse-num id=v45013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. <b class=verse-num id=v45013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45014001_01-1>Do Not Pass Judgment on One Another</h3><p id=p45014001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. <b class=verse-num id=v45014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. <b class=verse-num id=v45014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. <b class=verse-num id=v45014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</p><p id=p45014004_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <b class=verse-num id=v45014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. <b class=verse-num id=v45014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. <b class=verse-num id=v45014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v45014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</p><p id=p45014009_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; <b class=verse-num id=v45014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>for it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45014011_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,</span><br /><span id=p45014011_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every tongue shall confess to God.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45014011_08-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v45014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.</p><h3 id=p45014012_08-1>Do Not Cause Another to Stumble</h3><p id=p45014012_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. <b class=verse-num id=v45014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v45014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. <b class=verse-num id=v45014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. <b class=verse-num id=v45014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v45014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. <b class=verse-num id=v45014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.</p><p id=p45014019_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. <b class=verse-num id=v45014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. <b class=verse-num id=v45014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. <b class=verse-num id=v45014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.</p></div>

<h3 id=p21008001_01-1>Keep the King&#8217;s Command</h3><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p21008001_05-1 class=line><b class=chapter-num id=v21008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is like the wise?</span><br /><span id=p21008001_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who knows the interpretation of a thing?</span><br /><span id=p21008001_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;A man&#8217;s wisdom makes his face shine,</span><br /><span id=p21008001_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hardness of his face is changed.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p21008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=verse-num id=v21008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I say: Keep the king&#8217;s command, because of God&#8217;s oath to him. <b class=verse-num id=v21008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Be not hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases. <b class=verse-num id=v21008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v21008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way. <b class=verse-num id=v21008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For there is a time and a way for everything, although man&#8217;s trouble lies heavy on him. <b class=verse-num id=v21008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be? <b class=verse-num id=v21008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death. There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v21008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.</p><h3 id=p21008009_05-1>Those Who Fear God Will Do Well</h3><p id=p21008009_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v21008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity. <b class=verse-num id=v21008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil. <b class=verse-num id=v21008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him. <b class=verse-num id=v21008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.</p><h3 id=p21008013_12-1>Man Cannot Know God&#8217;s Ways</h3><p id=p21008013_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v21008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity. <b class=verse-num id=v21008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.</p><p id=p21008015_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v21008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one&#8217;s eyes see sleep, <b class=verse-num id=v21008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out.</p></div>

<h3 id=p21009001_01-1>Death Comes to All</h3><p id=p21009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v21009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him. <b class=verse-num id=v21009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath. <b class=verse-num id=v21009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v21009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. <b class=verse-num id=v21009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten. <b class=verse-num id=v21009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.</p><h3 id=p21009006_05-1>Enjoy Life with the One You Love</h3><p id=p21009006_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v21009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.</p><p id=p21009007_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v21009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.</p><p id=p21009008_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v21009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun. <b class=verse-num id=v21009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</p><h3 id=p21009010_12-1>Wisdom Better Than Folly</h3><p id=p21009010_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v21009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all. <b class=verse-num id=v21009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.</p><p id=p21009012_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v21009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me. <b class=verse-num id=v21009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it. <b class=verse-num id=v21009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man. <b class=verse-num id=v21009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man&#8217;s wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.</p><p id=p21009016_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v21009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools. <b class=verse-num id=v21009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</p></div>

<h3 id=p27005001_01-1>The Handwriting on the Wall</h3><p id=p27005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.</p><p id=p27005001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them. <b class=verse-num id=v27005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then they brought in the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them. <b class=verse-num id=v27005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.</p><p id=p27005004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king&#8217;s palace, opposite the lampstand. And the king saw the hand as it wrote. <b class=verse-num id=v27005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the king&#8217;s color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together. <b class=verse-num id=v27005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The king called loudly to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king declared to the wise men of Babylon, &#8220;Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then all the king&#8217;s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed, and his lords were perplexed.</p><p id=p27005009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall, and the queen declared, &#8220;O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change. <b class=verse-num id=v27005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father&#8212;your father the king&#8212;made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers, <b class=verse-num id=v27005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p27005012_06-1>Daniel Interprets the Handwriting</h3><p id=p27005012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, &#8220;You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v27005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you. <b class=verse-num id=v27005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v27005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.&#8221;</p><p id=p27005016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, &#8220;Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty. <b class=verse-num id=v27005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled. <b class=verse-num id=v27005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him. <b class=verse-num id=v27005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will. <b class=verse-num id=v27005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, <b class=verse-num id=v27005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.</p><p id=p27005023_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed. <b class=verse-num id=v27005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN. <b class=verse-num id=v27005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; <b class=verse-num id=v27005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; <b class=verse-num id=v27005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.&#8221;</p><p id=p27005028_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p><p id=p27005029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed. <b class=verse-num id=v27005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.</p></div>

<h3 id=p27006001_01-1>Daniel and the Lions&#8217; Den</h3><p id=p27006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom; <b class=verse-num id=v27006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss. <b class=verse-num id=v27006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v27006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. <b class=verse-num id=v27006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then these men said, &#8220;We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, &#8220;O King Darius, live forever! <b class=verse-num id=v27006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. <b class=verse-num id=v27006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.</p><p id=p27006009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. <b class=verse-num id=v27006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God. <b class=verse-num id=v27006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, &#8220;O king! Did you not sign an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?&#8221; The king answered and said, &#8220;The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they answered and said before the king, &#8220;Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006013_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him. <b class=verse-num id=v27006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, &#8220;Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared to Daniel, &#8220;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. <b class=verse-num id=v27006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.</p><p id=p27006018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. <b class=verse-num id=v27006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, &#8220;O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Daniel said to the king, &#8220;O king, live forever! <b class=verse-num id=v27006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>My God sent his angel and shut the lions&#8217; mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. <b class=verse-num id=v27006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king commanded, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions&#8212;they, their children, and their wives.

Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v27007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Daniel declared, &#8220;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. <b class=verse-num id=v27007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. <b class=verse-num id=v27007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The first was like a lion and had eagles&#8217; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v27007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &#8216;Arise, devour much flesh.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v27007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v27007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. <b class=verse-num id=v27007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots.

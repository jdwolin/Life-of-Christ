They are a gift to you, given to the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting. <b class=verse-num id=v04018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood as a gift, and any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.&#8221;</p><p id=p04018007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, &#8220;Behold, I have given you charge of the contributions made to me, all the consecrated things of the people of Israel. I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual due. <b class=verse-num id=v04018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every guilt offering of theirs, which they render to me, shall be most holy to you and to your sons. <b class=verse-num id=v04018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In a most holy place shall you eat it. Every male may eat it; it is holy to you. <b class=verse-num id=v04018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>This also is yours: the contribution of their gift, all the wave offerings of the people of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it. <b class=verse-num id=v04018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>All the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the grain, the firstfruits of what they give to the LORD, I give to you. <b class=verse-num id=v04018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours.

Nevertheless, the firstborn of man you shall redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem. <b class=verse-num id=v04018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And their redemption price (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. <b class=verse-num id=v04018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall burn their fat as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v04018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But their flesh shall be yours, as the breast that is waved and as the right thigh are yours. <b class=verse-num id=v04018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>All the holy contributions that the people of Israel present to the LORD I give to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due.

But you shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, lest you die.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

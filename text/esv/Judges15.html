<h3 id=p07014001_01-1>Samson&#8217;s Marriage</h3><p id=p07014001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v07014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then he came up and told his father and mother, &#8220;I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah. Now get her for me as my wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But his father and mother said to him, &#8220;Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?&#8221; But Samson said to his father, &#8220;Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes.&#8221;</p><p id=p07014003_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>His father and mother did not know that it was from the LORD, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.</p><p id=p07014004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring. <b class=verse-num id=v07014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. <b class=verse-num id=v07014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson&#8217;s eyes.</p><p id=p07014007_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. <b class=verse-num id=v07014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.</p><p id=p07014009_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do. <b class=verse-num id=v07014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. <b class=verse-num id=v07014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Samson said to them, &#8220;Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes, <b class=verse-num id=v07014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.&#8221; And they said to him, &#8220;Put your riddle, that we may hear it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said to them,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p07014014_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Out of the eater came something to eat.</span><br /><span id=p07014014_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the strong came something sweet.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p07014014_03-1 class=same-paragraph>And in three days they could not solve the riddle.</p><p id=p07014014_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>On the fourth day they said to Samson&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, lest we burn you and your father&#8217;s house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Samson&#8217;s wife wept over him and said, &#8220;You only hate me; you do not love me. You have put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is.&#8221; And he said to her, &#8220;Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people. <b class=verse-num id=v07014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p07014018_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What is sweeter than honey?</span><br /><span id=p07014018_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is stronger than a lion?&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p07014018_03-1 class=same-paragraph>And he said to them,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p07014018_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;If you had not plowed with my heifer,</span><br /><span id=p07014018_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;you would not have found out my riddle.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p07014018_03-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v07014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v07014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Samson&#8217;s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.</p></div>

<h3 id=p07015001_01-1>Samson Defeats the Philistines</h3><p id=p07015001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he said, &#8220;I will go in to my wife in the chamber.&#8221; But her father would not allow him to go in. <b class=verse-num id=v07015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And her father said, &#8220;I really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Samson said to them, &#8220;This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails. <b class=verse-num id=v07015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards. <b class=verse-num id=v07015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the Philistines said, &#8220;Who has done this?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.&#8221; And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v07015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Samson said to them, &#8220;If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</p><p id=p07015008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. <b class=verse-num id=v07015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the men of Judah said, &#8220;Why have you come up against us?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, &#8220;Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?&#8221; And he said to them, &#8220;As they did to me, so have I done to them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.&#8221; And Samson said to them, &#8220;Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you.&#8221; So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.</p><p id=p07015013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands. <b class=verse-num id=v07015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men. <b class=verse-num id=v07015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Samson said,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p07015016_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;With the jawbone of a donkey,</span><br /><span id=p07015016_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaps upon heaps,</span><br /><span id=p07015016_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;with the jawbone of a donkey</span><br /><span id=p07015016_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have I struck down a thousand men.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p07015016_05-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v07015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.</p><p id=p07015017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the LORD and said, &#8220;You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore; it is at Lehi to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v07015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p></div>

They kept quiet all night, saying, &#8220;Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron.</p><p id=p07016003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. <b class=verse-num id=v07016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, &#8220;Seduce him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to humble him. And we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Delilah said to Samson, &#8220;Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you.&#8221;</p><p id=p07016006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Samson said to her, &#8220;If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. <b class=verse-num id=v07016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, &#8220;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&#8221; But he snapped the bowstrings, as a thread of flax snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.</p><p id=p07016009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Delilah said to Samson, &#8220;Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you might be bound.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, &#8220;If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, &#8220;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&#8221; And the men lying in ambush were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.</p><p id=p07016012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Delilah said to Samson, &#8220;Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you might be bound.&#8221; And he said to her, &#8220;If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and fasten it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web. And she made them tight with the pin and said to him, &#8220;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&#8221; But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.</p><p id=p07016014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And she said to him, &#8220;How can you say, &#8216;I love you,&#8217; when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me where your great strength lies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death. <b class=verse-num id=v07016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he told her all his heart, and said to her, &#8220;A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother&#8217;s womb. If my head is shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man.&#8221;</p><p id=p07016017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, &#8220;Come up again, for he has told me all his heart.&#8221; Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v07016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>She made him sleep on her knees. And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. <b class=verse-num id=v07016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&#8221; And he awoke from his sleep and said, &#8220;I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.&#8221; But he did not know that the LORD had left him. <b class=verse-num id=v07016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles. And he ground at the mill in the prison. <b class=verse-num id=v07016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.</p><h3 id=p07016022_04-1>The Death of Samson</h3><p id=p07016022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, &#8220;Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, &#8220;Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when their hearts were merry, they said, &#8220;Call Samson, that he may entertain us.&#8221; So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. <b class=verse-num id=v07016026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, &#8220;Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women, who looked on while Samson entertained.</p><p id=p07016027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Samson called to the LORD and said, &#8220;O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other. <b class=verse-num id=v07016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Samson said, &#8220;Let me die with the Philistines.&#8221; Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life. <b class=verse-num id=v07016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10002001_01-1>David Anointed King of Judah</h3><p id=p10002001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>After this David inquired of the LORD, &#8220;Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?&#8221; And the LORD said to him, &#8220;Go up.&#8221; David said, &#8220;To which shall I go up?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;To Hebron.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. <b class=verse-num id=v10002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David brought up his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron. <b class=verse-num id=v10002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.</p><p id=p10002004_06-1>When they told David, &#8220;It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, &#8220;May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him. <b class=verse-num id=v10002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing. <b class=verse-num id=v10002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10002007_06-1>Ish-bosheth Made King of Israel</h3><p id=p10002007_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul&#8217;s army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim, <b class=verse-num id=v10002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. <b class=verse-num id=v10002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p><h3 id=p10002011_11-1>The Battle of Gibeon</h3><p id=p10002011_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v10002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <b class=verse-num id=v10002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Abner said to Joab, &#8220;Let the young men arise and compete before us.&#8221; And Joab said, &#8220;Let them arise.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. <b class=verse-num id=v10002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent&#8217;s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v10002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.</p><p id=p10002017_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle. <b class=verse-num id=v10002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <b class=verse-num id=v10002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Abner looked behind him and said, &#8220;Is it you, Asahel?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;It is I.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Abner said to him, &#8220;Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil.&#8221; But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <b class=verse-num id=v10002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Abner said again to Asahel, &#8220;Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.</p><p id=p10002023_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v10002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill. <b class=verse-num id=v10002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Abner called to Joab, &#8220;Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Joab said, &#8220;As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.</p><p id=p10002028_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David&#8217;s servants nineteen men besides Asahel. <b class=verse-num id=v10002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner&#8217;s men. <b class=verse-num id=v10002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10003001_01-1>Abner Joins David</h3><p id=p10003001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.</p><p id=p10003001_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel; <b class=verse-num id=v10003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <b class=verse-num id=v10003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <b class=verse-num id=v10003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David&#8217;s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</p><p id=p10003005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v10003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, &#8220;Why have you gone in to my father&#8217;s concubine?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, &#8220;Am I a dog&#8217;s head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman. <b class=verse-num id=v10003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him, <b class=verse-num id=v10003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</p><p id=p10003011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, &#8220;To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, when you come to see my face.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, saying, &#8220;Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish. <b class=verse-num id=v10003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, &#8220;Go, return.&#8221; And he returned.</p><p id=p10003016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, &#8220;For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you. <b class=verse-num id=v10003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now then bring it about, for the LORD has promised David, saying, &#8216;By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Abner also spoke to Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.</p><p id=p10003019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Abner said to David, &#8220;I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.&#8221; So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</p><p id=p10003021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. <b class=verse-num id=v10003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, &#8220;Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then Joab went to the king and said, &#8220;What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone? <b class=verse-num id=v10003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10003025_04-1>Joab Murders Abner</h3><p id=p10003025_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Joab came out from David&#8217;s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it. <b class=verse-num id=v10003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v10003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, &#8220;I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner. <b class=verse-num id=v10003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father&#8217;s house, and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or who is leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.</p><h3 id=p10003030_07-1>David Mourns Abner</h3><p id=p10003030_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, &#8220;Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.&#8221; And King David followed the bier. <b class=verse-num id=v10003032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. <b class=verse-num id=v10003033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the king lamented for Abner, saying,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p10003033_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Should Abner die as a fool dies?</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v10003034-1>34&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hands were not bound;</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your feet were not fettered;</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;as one falls before the wicked</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have fallen.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p10003034_10-1 class=same-paragraph>And all the people wept again over him. <b class=verse-num id=v10003035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day. But David swore, saying, &#8220;God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people. <b class=verse-num id=v10003037-1>37&nbsp;</b>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king&#8217;s will to put to death Abner the son of Ner. <b class=verse-num id=v10003038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And the king said to his servants, &#8220;Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v10003039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And I was gentle today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. The LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!&#8221;</p></div>

He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p><p id=p10004004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest. <b class=verse-num id=v10004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v10004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him.

The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, &#8220;As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity, <b class=verse-num id=v10004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>when one told me, &#8216;Behold, Saul is dead,&#8217; and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. <b class=verse-num id=v10004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron.

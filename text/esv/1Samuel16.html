<h3 id=p09015001_01-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Rejects Saul</h3><p id=p09015001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD of hosts, &#8216;I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v09015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p09015003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v09015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. <b class=verse-num id=v09015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to the Kenites, &#8220;Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&#8221; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <b class=verse-num id=v09015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v09015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v09015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.</p><p id=p09015009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to Samuel: <b class=verse-num id=v09015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.&#8221; And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night. <b class=verse-num id=v09015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, &#8220;Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, &#8220;Blessed be you to the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said, &#8220;What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Saul said, &#8220;They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night.&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Speak.&#8221;</p><p id=p09015016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said, &#8220;Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v09015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, &#8216;Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have obeyed the voice of the LORD. I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction. <b class=verse-num id=v09015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p09015022_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,</span><br /><span id=p09015022_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in obeying the voice of the LORD?</span><br /><span id=p09015022_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,</span><br /><span id=p09015022_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to listen than the fat of rams.</span><br /><span id=p09015023_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v09015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For rebellion is as the sin of divination,</span><br /><span id=p09015023_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry.</span><br /><span id=p09015023_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you have rejected the word of the LORD,</span><br /><span id=p09015023_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has also rejected you from being king.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p09015023_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. <b class=verse-num id=v09015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me that I may bow before the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore. <b class=verse-num id=v09015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to him, &#8220;The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you. <b class=verse-num id=v09015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow before the LORD your God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the LORD.</p><p id=p09015031_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said, &#8220;Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.&#8221; And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, &#8220;Surely the bitterness of death is past.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said, &#8220;As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.&#8221; And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</p><p id=p09015033_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v09015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p></div>

Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said, &#8220;How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.&#8221; And the LORD said, &#8220;Take a heifer with you and say, &#8216;I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said, &#8220;Do you come peaceably?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&#8221; And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</p><p id=p09016005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, &#8220;Surely the LORD&#8217;s anointed is before him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;The LORD has not chosen these.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Are all your sons here?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.&#8221; And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, &#8220;Arise, anoint him, for this is he.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.

And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer. <b class=verse-num id=v09016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &#8220;Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.</p></div>

And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. <b class=verse-num id=v09017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them. <b class=verse-num id=v09017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. <b class=verse-num id=v09017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v09017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. <b class=verse-num id=v09017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The shaft of his spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam, and his spear&#8217;s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, &#8220;Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. <b class=verse-num id=v09017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants.

In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years. <b class=verse-num id=v09017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. <b class=verse-num id=v09017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul, <b class=verse-num id=v09017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father&#8217;s sheep at Bethlehem. <b class=verse-num id=v09017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.</p><p id=p09017016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesse said to David his son, &#8220;Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v09017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand.

And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, <b class=verse-num id=v09017035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221; And Saul said to David, &#8220;Go, and the LORD be with you!&#8221;</p><p id=p09017037_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail, <b class=verse-num id=v09017039-1>39&nbsp;</b>and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, &#8220;I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.&#8221; So David put them off. <b class=verse-num id=v09017040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd&#8217;s pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.</p><p id=p09017040_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v09017043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said to David, &#8220;Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?&#8221; And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <b class=verse-num id=v09017044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The Philistine said to David, &#8220;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the Philistine, &#8220;You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <b class=verse-num id=v09017046-1>46&nbsp;</b>This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v09017047-1>47&nbsp;</b>and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD&#8217;s, and he will give you into our hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017047_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017048-1>48&nbsp;</b>When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. <b class=verse-num id=v09017049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p><p id=p09017049_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017050-1>50&nbsp;</b>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David. <b class=verse-num id=v09017051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. <b class=verse-num id=v09017052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron. <b class=verse-num id=v09017053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. <b class=verse-num id=v09017054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</p><p id=p09017054_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017055-1>55&nbsp;</b>As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, &#8220;Abner, whose son is this youth?&#8221; And Abner said, &#8220;As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017056-1>56&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Inquire whose son the boy is.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017057-1>57&nbsp;</b>And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09017058-1>58&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Whose son are you, young man?&#8221; And David answered, &#8220;I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&#8221;</p></div>

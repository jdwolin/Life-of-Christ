He who loves his wife loves himself. <b class=verse-num id=v49005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, <b class=verse-num id=v49005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>because we are members of his body. <b class=verse-num id=v49005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v49005032-1>32&nbsp;</b>This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. <b class=verse-num id=v49005033-1>33&nbsp;</b>However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</p></div>

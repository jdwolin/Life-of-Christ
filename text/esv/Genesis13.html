<h3 id=p01012001_01-1>The Call of Abram</h3><p id=p01012001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>Now the LORD said to Abram, &#8220;Go from your country and your kindred and your father&#8217;s house to the land that I will show you. <b class=verse-num id=v01012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. <b class=verse-num id=v01012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&#8221;</p><p id=p01012003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. <b class=verse-num id=v01012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&#8217;s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, <b class=verse-num id=v01012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, &#8220;To your offspring I will give this land.&#8221; So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.</p><h3 id=p01012009_05-1>Abram and Sarai in Egypt</h3><p id=p01012009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, &#8220;I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, <b class=verse-num id=v01012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, &#8216;This is his wife.&#8217; Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. <b class=verse-num id=v01012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. <b class=verse-num id=v01012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.</p><p id=p01012016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram&#8217;s wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So Pharaoh called Abram and said, &#8220;What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? <b class=verse-num id=v01012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Why did you say, &#8216;She is my sister,&#8217; so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.</p></div>

And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, <b class=verse-num id=v01013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, <b class=verse-num id=v01013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&#8217;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&#8217;s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.</p><p id=p01013007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Abram said to Lot, &#8220;Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. <b class=verse-num id=v01013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) <b class=verse-num id=v01013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. <b class=verse-num id=v01013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. <b class=verse-num id=v01013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.</p><p id=p01013013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, &#8220;Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, <b class=verse-num id=v01013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. <b class=verse-num id=v01013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. <b class=verse-num id=v01013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.</p></div>

And he was transfigured before them, <b class=verse-num id=v41009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them. <b class=verse-num id=v41009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v41009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. <b class=verse-num id=v41009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &#8220;This is my beloved Son; listen to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</p><p id=p41009008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v41009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. <b class=verse-num id=v41009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they asked him, &#8220;Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41009013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41009013_03-1>Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit</h3><p id=p41009013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. <b class=verse-num id=v41009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. <b class=verse-num id=v41009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he asked them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What are you arguing about with them?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And someone from the crowd answered him, &#8220;Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. <b class=verse-num id=v41009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v41009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Jesus asked his father, <span class=woc>&#8220;How long has this been happening to him?&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;From childhood. <b class=verse-num id=v41009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;If you can&#8217;! All things are possible for one who believes.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, &#8220;I believe; help my unbelief!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, <span class=woc>&#8220;You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. <b class=verse-num id=v41009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41009029_11-1>Jesus Again Foretells Death, Resurrection</h3><p id=p41009029_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, <b class=verse-num id=v41009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p><h3 id=p41009032_16-1>Who Is the Greatest?</h3><p id=p41009032_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What were you discussing on the way?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. <b class=verse-num id=v41009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, <b class=verse-num woc id=v41009037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41009037_20-1>Anyone Not Against Us Is for Us</h3><p id=p41009037_27-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>John said to him, &#8220;Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41009040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the one who is not against us is for us.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41009041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.</span></p><h3 id=p41009041_27-1>Temptations to Sin</h3><p id=p41009041_30-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v41009042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41009043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.

Untie it and bring it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011003-1>3&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If anyone says to you, &#8216;Why are you doing this?&#8217; say, &#8216;The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. <b class=verse-num id=v41011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And some of those standing there said to them, &#8220;What are you doing, untying the colt?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. <b class=verse-num id=v41011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. <b class=verse-num id=v41011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. <b class=verse-num id=v41011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, &#8220;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! <b class=verse-num id=v41011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!&#8221;</p><p id=p41011010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p><h3 id=p41011011_04-1>Jesus Curses the Fig Tree</h3><p id=p41011011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. <b class=verse-num id=v41011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <b class=verse-num id=v41011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said to it, <span class=woc>&#8220;May no one ever eat fruit from you again.&#8221;</span> And his disciples heard it.</p><h3 id=p41011014_09-1>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3><p id=p41011014_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. <b class=verse-num id=v41011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v41011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he was teaching them and saying to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Is it not written, &#8216;My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations&#8217;? But you have made it a den of robbers.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. <b class=verse-num id=v41011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when evening came they went out of the city.</p><h3 id=p41011019_13-1>The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree</h3><p id=p41011019_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. <b class=verse-num id=v41011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Peter remembered and said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have faith in God.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, &#8216;Be taken up and thrown into the sea,&#8217; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41011025_20-1>The Authority of Jesus Challenged</h3><p id=p41011025_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, <b class=verse-num id=v41011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>and they said to him, &#8220;By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they discussed it with one another, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; he will say, &#8216;Why then did you not believe him?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v41011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But shall we say, &#8216;From man&#8217;?&#8221;&#8212;they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v41011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they answered Jesus, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&#8221;</span></p></div>

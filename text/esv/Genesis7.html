<h3 id=p01006001_01-1>Increasing Corruption on Earth</h3><p id=p01006001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, <b class=verse-num id=v01006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. <b class=verse-num id=v01006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said, &#8220;My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.</p><p id=p01006004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. <b class=verse-num id=v01006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. <b class=verse-num id=v01006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So the LORD said, &#8220;I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</p><h3 id=p01006008_05-1>Noah and the Flood</h3><p id=p01006008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God. <b class=verse-num id=v01006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p><p id=p01006010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now the earth was corrupt in God&#8217;s sight, and the earth was filled with violence. <b class=verse-num id=v01006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v01006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And God said to Noah, &#8220;I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v01006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. <b class=verse-num id=v01006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v01006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks. <b class=verse-num id=v01006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die. <b class=verse-num id=v01006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons&#8217; wives with you. <b class=verse-num id=v01006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. <b class=verse-num id=v01006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. <b class=verse-num id=v01006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.</p></div>

And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided. <b class=verse-num id=v01008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, <b class=verse-num id=v01008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated, <b class=verse-num id=v01008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. <b class=verse-num id=v01008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.</p><p id=p01008005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made <b class=verse-num id=v01008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v01008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. <b class=verse-num id=v01008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v01008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.</p><p id=p01008012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth.

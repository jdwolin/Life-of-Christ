And the twelve were with him, <b class=verse-num id=v42008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, <b class=verse-num id=v42008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod&#8217;s household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.</p><h3 id=p42008003_04-1>The Parable of the Sower</h3><p id=p42008003_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.&#8221;</span> As he said these things, he called out, <span class=woc>&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42008008_09-1>The Purpose of the Parables</h3><p id=p42008008_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, <b class=verse-num id=v42008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that &#8216;seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.</span></p><h3 id=p42008015_14-1>A Lamp Under a Jar</h3><p id=p42008015_19-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v42008016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42008018_19-1>Jesus&#8217; Mother and Brothers</h3><p id=p42008018_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v42008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he was told, &#8220;Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42008021_23-1>Jesus Calms a Storm</h3><p id=p42008021_27-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let us go across to the other side of the lake.&#8221;</span> So they set out, <b class=verse-num id=v42008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. <b class=verse-num id=v42008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they went and woke him, saying, &#8220;Master, Master, we are perishing!&#8221; And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm. <b class=verse-num id=v42008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Where is your faith?&#8221;</span> And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, &#8220;Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p42008025_27-1>Jesus Heals a Man with a Demon</h3><p id=p42008025_34-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. <b class=verse-num id=v42008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. <b class=verse-num id=v42008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, &#8220;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) <b class=verse-num id=v42008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Jesus then asked him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;Legion,&#8221; for many demons had entered him. <b class=verse-num id=v42008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. <b class=verse-num id=v42008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. <b class=verse-num id=v42008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</p><p id=p42008033_34-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. <b class=verse-num id=v42008035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v42008036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed. <b class=verse-num id=v42008037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. <b class=verse-num id=v42008038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&#8221;</span> And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</p><h3 id=p42008039_34-1>Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus&#8217;s Daughter</h3><p id=p42008039_41-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. <b class=verse-num id=v42008041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus&#8217; feet, he implored him to come to his house, <b class=verse-num id=v42008042-1>42&nbsp;</b>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.</p><p id=p42008042_41-1>As Jesus went, the people pressed around him. <b class=verse-num id=v42008043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone. <b class=verse-num id=v42008044-1>44&nbsp;</b>She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased. <b class=verse-num id=v42008045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Who was it that touched me?&#8221;</span> When all denied it, Peter said, &#8220;Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42008046-1>46&nbsp;</b>But Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42008047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. <b class=verse-num id=v42008048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42008048_41-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008049-1>49&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler&#8217;s house came and said, &#8220;Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42008050-1>50&nbsp;</b>But Jesus on hearing this answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42008051-1>51&nbsp;</b>And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. <b class=verse-num id=v42008052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42008053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <b class=verse-num id=v42008054-1>54&nbsp;</b>But taking her by the hand he called, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Child, arise.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42008055-1>55&nbsp;</b>And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat. <b class=verse-num id=v42008056-1>56&nbsp;</b>And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</p></div>

And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida. <b class=verse-num id=v42009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. <b class=verse-num id=v42009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, &#8220;Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;We have no more than five loaves and two fish&#8212;unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For there were about five thousand men.

If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies&#8212;he may flee to one of these cities and live, <b class=verse-num id=v05019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past. <b class=verse-num id=v05019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities. <b class=verse-num id=v05019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways&#8212;then you shall add three other cities to these three, <b class=verse-num id=v05019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.</p><p id=p05019010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities, <b class=verse-num id=v05019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die. <b class=verse-num id=v05019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may be well with you.</p><h3 id=p05019013_06-1>Property Boundaries</h3><p id=p05019013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You shall not move your neighbor&#8217;s landmark, which the men of old have set, in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.</p><h3 id=p05019014_08-1>Laws Concerning Witnesses</h3><p id=p05019014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed.

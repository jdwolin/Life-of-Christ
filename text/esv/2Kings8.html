<h3 id=p12007001_01-1>Elisha Promises Food</h3><p id=p12007001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>But Elisha said, &#8220;Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, &#8220;If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?&#8221; But he said, &#8220;You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p12007002_04-1>The Syrians Flee</h3><p id=p12007002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v12007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate. And they said to one another, &#8220;Why are we sitting here until we die? <b class=verse-num id=v12007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>If we say, &#8216;Let us enter the city,&#8217; the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there. <b class=verse-num id=v12007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, &#8220;Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives. <b class=verse-num id=v12007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and went and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent and carried off things from it and went and hid them.</p><p id=p12007008_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v12007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then they said to one another, &#8220;We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come; let us go and tell the king&#8217;s household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, &#8220;We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king&#8217;s household. <b class=verse-num id=v12007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the king rose in the night and said to his servants, &#8220;I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, &#8216;When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And one of his servants said, &#8220;Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel who have already perished. Let us send and see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So they took two horsemen, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, &#8220;Go and see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So they went after them as far as the Jordan, and behold, all the way was littered with garments and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.</p><p id=p12007015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v12007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. And the people trampled him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him. <b class=verse-num id=v12007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For when the man of God had said to the king, &#8220;Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>the captain had answered the man of God, &#8220;If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?&#8221; And he had said, &#8220;You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate and he died.</p></div>

She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. <b class=verse-num id=v12008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land. <b class=verse-num id=v12008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, &#8220;Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And while he was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, &#8220;My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, &#8220;Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p12008006_05-1>Hazael Murders Ben-hadad</h3><p id=p12008006_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Elisha came to Damascus. Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And when it was told him, &#8220;The man of God has come here,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>the king said to Hazael, &#8220;Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this sickness?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camels&#8217; loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, &#8220;Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this sickness?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Go, say to him, &#8216;You shall certainly recover,&#8217; but the LORD has shown me that he shall certainly die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was embarrassed. And the man of God wept. <b class=verse-num id=v12008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Hazael said, &#8220;Why does my lord weep?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Hazael said, &#8220;What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?&#8221; Elisha answered, &#8220;The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, &#8220;What did Elisha say to you?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;He told me that you would certainly recover.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the next day he took the bed cloth and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died.

And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.</p><p id=p12008019_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v12008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king of their own. <b class=verse-num id=v12008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Joram passed over to Zair with all his chariots and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders struck the Edomites who had surrounded him, but his army fled home. <b class=verse-num id=v12008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. <b class=verse-num id=v12008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? <b class=verse-num id=v12008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</p><h3 id=p12008024_12-1>Ahaziah Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p12008024_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign. <b class=verse-num id=v12008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Athaliah; she was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.</p><p id=p12008027_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram. <b class=verse-num id=v12008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.

And go in and have him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber. <b class=verse-num id=v12009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.&#8217; Then open the door and flee; do not linger.&#8221;</p><p id=p12009003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v12009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council. And he said, &#8220;I have a word for you, O commander.&#8221; And Jehu said, &#8220;To which of us all?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;To you, O commander.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So he arose and went into the house. And the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v12009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. <b class=verse-num id=v12009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.&#8221; Then he opened the door and fled.</p><p id=p12009010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, &#8220;Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?&#8221; And he said to them, &#8220;You know the fellow and his talk.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;That is not true; tell us now.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then in haste every man of them took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, &#8220;Jehu is king.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p12009013_06-1>Jehu Assassinates Joram and Ahaziah</h3><p id=p12009013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Syria, <b class=verse-num id=v12009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, &#8220;If this is your decision, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.</p><p id=p12009016_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came and said, &#8220;I see a company.&#8221; And Joram said, &#8220;Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, &#8216;Is it peace?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So a man on horseback went to meet him and said, &#8220;Thus says the king, &#8216;Is it peace?&#8217;&#8221; And Jehu said, &#8220;What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me.&#8221; And the watchman reported, saying, &#8220;The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, &#8220;Thus the king has said, &#8216;Is it peace?&#8217;&#8221; And Jehu answered, &#8220;What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Again the watchman reported, &#8220;He reached them, but he is not coming back.

For remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the LORD made this pronouncement against him: <b class=verse-num id=v12009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8216;As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons&#8212;declares the LORD&#8212;I will repay you on this plot of ground.&#8217; Now therefore take him up and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p12009026_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him and said, &#8220;Shoot him also.&#8221; And they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there. <b class=verse-num id=v12009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.</p><p id=p12009028_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.</p><h3 id=p12009029_11-1>Jehu Executes Jezebel</h3><p id=p12009029_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v12009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. And she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out of the window. <b class=verse-num id=v12009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, &#8220;Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And he lifted up his face to the window and said, &#8220;Who is on my side? Who?&#8221; Two or three eunuchs looked out at him. <b class=verse-num id=v12009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Throw her down.&#8221; So they threw her down. And some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her. <b class=verse-num id=v12009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then he went in and ate and drank. And he said, &#8220;See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands. <b class=verse-num id=v12009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>When they came back and told him, he said, &#8220;This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite: &#8216;In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel, <b class=verse-num id=v12009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

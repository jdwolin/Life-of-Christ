<p id=p07003001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Now these are the nations that the LORD left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan. <b class=verse-num id=v07003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before. <b class=verse-num id=v07003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. <b class=verse-num id=v07003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v07003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <b class=verse-num id=v07003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.</p><h3 id=p07003006_01-1>Othniel</h3><p id=p07003006_02-1><b class=verse-num id=v07003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. <b class=verse-num id=v07003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. <b class=verse-num id=v07003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother. <b class=verse-num id=v07003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. <b class=verse-num id=v07003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p><h3 id=p07003011_02-1>Ehud</h3><p id=p07003011_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v07003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms. <b class=verse-num id=v07003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p><p id=p07003014_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. <b class=verse-num id=v07003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. <b class=verse-num id=v07003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. <b class=verse-num id=v07003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. <b class=verse-num id=v07003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, &#8220;I have a secret message for you, O king.&#8221; And he commanded, &#8220;Silence.&#8221; And all his attendants went out from his presence. <b class=verse-num id=v07003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, &#8220;I have a message from God for you.&#8221; And he arose from his seat. <b class=verse-num id=v07003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. <b class=verse-num id=v07003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out. <b class=verse-num id=v07003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them.</p><p id=p07003023_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, &#8220;Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.</p><p id=p07003025_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. <b class=verse-num id=v07003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader. <b class=verse-num id=v07003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&#8221; So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over. <b class=verse-num id=v07003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v07003030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.</p><h3 id=p07003030_03-1>Shamgar</h3><p id=p07003030_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07003031-1>31&nbsp;</b>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.</p></div>

The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. <b class=verse-num id=v07004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.</p><p id=p07004003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. <b class=verse-num id=v07004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v07004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, &#8220;Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, &#8216;Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun. <b class=verse-num id=v07004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin&#8217;s army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Barak said to her, &#8220;If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.&#8221; Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. <b class=verse-num id=v07004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.</p><p id=p07004010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.</p><p id=p07004011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, <b class=verse-num id=v07004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. <b class=verse-num id=v07004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Deborah said to Barak, &#8220;Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?&#8221; So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him. <b class=verse-num id=v07004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. <b class=verse-num id=v07004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</p><p id=p07004016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <b class=verse-num id=v07004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, &#8220;Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid.&#8221; So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. <b class=verse-num id=v07004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, &#8220;Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.&#8221; So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. <b class=verse-num id=v07004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, &#8220;Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, &#8216;Is anyone here?&#8217; say, &#8216;No.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died. <b class=verse-num id=v07004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, &#8220;Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.&#8221; So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.</p><p id=p07004022_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v07004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v07004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p></div>

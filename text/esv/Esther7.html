<h3 id=p17006001_01-1>The King Honors Mordecai</h3><p id=p17006001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>On that night the king could not sleep. And he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And it was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. <b class=verse-num id=v17006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&#8221; The king&#8217;s young men who attended him said, &#8220;Nothing has been done for him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Who is in the court?&#8221; Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king&#8217;s palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him. <b class=verse-num id=v17006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the king&#8217;s young men told him, &#8220;Haman is there, standing in the court.&#8221; And the king said, &#8220;Let him come in.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Haman came in, and the king said to him, &#8220;What should be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?&#8221; And Haman said to himself, &#8220;Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Haman said to the king, &#8220;For the man whom the king delights to honor, <b class=verse-num id=v17006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set. <b class=verse-num id=v17006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king&#8217;s most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city, proclaiming before him: &#8216;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Haman, &#8220;Hurry; take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king&#8217;s gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, &#8220;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.&#8221;</p><p id=p17006011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai returned to the king&#8217;s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. <b class=verse-num id=v17006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, &#8220;If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p17006013_05-1>Esther Reveals Haman&#8217;s Plot</h3><p id=p17006013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v17006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>While they were yet talking with him, the king&#8217;s eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the feast that Esther had prepared.</p></div>

<p id=p17007001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. <b class=verse-num id=v17007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Queen Esther answered, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request. <b class=verse-num id=v17007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated.

And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her. <b class=verse-num id=v17008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p><p id=p17008002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, Esther rose and stood before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For how can I bear to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, &#8220;Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he intended to lay hands on the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king&#8217;s ring, for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king&#8217;s ring cannot be revoked.&#8221;</p><p id=p17008008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The king&#8217;s scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. And an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language. <b class=verse-num id=v17008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king&#8217;s signet ring. Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king&#8217;s service, bred from the royal stud, <b class=verse-num id=v17008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, children and women included, and to plunder their goods, <b class=verse-num id=v17008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. <b class=verse-num id=v17008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, being publicly displayed to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v17008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king&#8217;s service, rode out hurriedly, urged by the king&#8217;s command. And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.</p><p id=p17008014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a robe of fine linen and purple, and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. <b class=verse-num id=v17008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor. <b class=verse-num id=v17008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And in every province and in every city, wherever the king&#8217;s command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.</p></div>

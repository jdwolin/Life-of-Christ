They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. <b class=verse-num id=v04009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any of its bones; according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it. <b class=verse-num id=v04009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD&#8217;s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin. <b class=verse-num id=v04009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do.

And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning. <b class=verse-num id=v04009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So it was always: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night. <b class=verse-num id=v04009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped. <b class=verse-num id=v04009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp. <b class=verse-num id=v04009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out. <b class=verse-num id=v04009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.</p></div>

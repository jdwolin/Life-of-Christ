<h3 id=p10012001_01-1>Nathan Rebukes David</h3><p id=p10012001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, &#8220;There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. <b class=verse-num id=v10012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <b class=verse-num id=v10012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him. <b class=verse-num id=v10012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man&#8217;s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then David&#8217;s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, &#8220;As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die, <b class=verse-num id=v10012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.&#8221;</p><p id=p10012006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Nathan said to David, &#8220;You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v10012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I gave you your master&#8217;s house and your master&#8217;s wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. <b class=verse-num id=v10012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v10012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. <b class=verse-num id=v10012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>David said to Nathan, &#8220;I have sinned against the LORD.&#8221; And Nathan said to David, &#8220;The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die. <b class=verse-num id=v10012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child who is born to you shall die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Nathan went to his house.</p><h3 id=p10012015_04-1>David&#8217;s Child Dies</h3><p id=p10012015_07-1>And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah&#8217;s wife bore to David, and he became sick. <b class=verse-num id=v10012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v10012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. <b class=verse-num id=v10012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, &#8220;Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, &#8220;Is the child dead?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. <b class=verse-num id=v10012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then his servants said to him, &#8220;What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, &#8216;Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10012023_07-1>Solomon&#8217;s Birth</h3><p id=p10012023_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him <b class=verse-num id=v10012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p><h3 id=p10012025_09-1>Rabbah Is Captured</h3><p id=p10012025_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city. <b class=verse-num id=v10012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, &#8220;I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. <b class=verse-num id=v10012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it. <b class=verse-num id=v10012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David&#8217;s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. <b class=verse-num id=v10012031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10013001_01-1>Amnon and Tamar</h3><p id=p10013001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom, David&#8217;s son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David&#8217;s son, loved her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man. <b class=verse-num id=v10013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?&#8221; Amnon said to him, &#8220;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jonadab said to him, &#8220;Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, &#8216;Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &#8220;Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p10013006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, &#8220;Go to your brother Amnon&#8217;s house and prepare food for him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#8217;s house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes. <b class=verse-num id=v10013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, &#8220;Send out everyone from me.&#8221; So everyone went out from him. <b class=verse-num id=v10013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Amnon said to Tamar, &#8220;Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.&#8221; And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <b class=verse-num id=v10013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &#8220;Come, lie with me, my sister.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>She answered him, &#8220;No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing. <b class=verse-num id=v10013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.</p><p id=p10013014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, &#8220;Get up! Go!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But she said to him, &#8220;No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.&#8221; But he would not listen to her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He called the young man who served him and said, &#8220;Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.</p><p id=p10013019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And her brother Absalom said to her, &#8220;Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart.&#8221; So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v10013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. <b class=verse-num id=v10013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.</p><h3 id=p10013022_04-1>Absalom Murders Amnon</h3><p id=p10013022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king&#8217;s sons. <b class=verse-num id=v10013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Absalom came to the king and said, &#8220;Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But the king said to Absalom, &#8220;No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.&#8221; He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing. <b class=verse-num id=v10013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, &#8220;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&#8221; And the king said to him, &#8220;Why should he go with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king&#8217;s sons go with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom commanded his servants, &#8220;Mark when Amnon&#8217;s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, &#8216;Strike Amnon,&#8217; then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&#8217;s sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.</p><p id=p10013029_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>While they were on the way, news came to David, &#8220;Absalom has struck down all the king&#8217;s sons, and not one of them is left.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v10013032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother, said, &#8220;Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king&#8217;s sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar. <b class=verse-num id=v10013033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king&#8217;s sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10013033_07-1>Absalom Flees to Geshur</h3><p id=p10013033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v10013035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Jonadab said to the king, &#8220;Behold, the king&#8217;s sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king&#8217;s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.</p><p id=p10013036_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day. <b class=verse-num id=v10013038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years. <b class=verse-num id=v10013039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10014001_01-1>Absalom Returns to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10014001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king&#8217;s heart went out to Absalom. <b class=verse-num id=v10014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, &#8220;Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v10014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Go to the king and speak thus to him.&#8221; So Joab put the words in her mouth.</p><p id=p10014003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, &#8220;Save me, O king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is your trouble?&#8221; She answered, &#8220;Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead. <b class=verse-num id=v10014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him. <b class=verse-num id=v10014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, &#8216;Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.&#8217; And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.&#8221;</p><p id=p10014007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to the woman, &#8220;Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, &#8220;On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father&#8217;s house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The king said, &#8220;If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then she said, &#8220;Please let the king invoke the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.&#8221;</p><p id=p10014011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the woman said, &#8220;Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the woman said, &#8220;Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again. <b class=verse-num id=v10014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast. <b class=verse-num id=v10014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, &#8216;I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. <b class=verse-num id=v10014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And your servant thought, &#8216;The word of my lord the king will set me at rest,&#8217; for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!&#8221;</p><p id=p10014017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king answered the woman, &#8220;Do not hide from me anything I ask you.&#8221; And the woman said, &#8220;Let my lord the king speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The king said, &#8220;Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?&#8221; The woman answered and said, &#8220;As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v10014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.&#8221;</p><p id=p10014020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Joab, &#8220;Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, &#8220;Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v10014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence.&#8221; So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king&#8217;s presence.</p><p id=p10014024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <b class=verse-num id=v10014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king&#8217;s weight. <b class=verse-num id=v10014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.</p><p id=p10014027_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king&#8217;s presence. <b class=verse-num id=v10014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come. <b class=verse-num id=v10014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he said to his servants, &#8220;See, Joab&#8217;s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.&#8221; So Absalom&#8217;s servants set the field on fire. <b class=verse-num id=v10014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, &#8220;Why have your servants set my field on fire?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Absalom answered Joab, &#8220;Behold, I sent word to you, &#8216;Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, &#8220;Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.&#8221; Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.</p></div>

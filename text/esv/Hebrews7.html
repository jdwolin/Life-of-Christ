<p id=p58006001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v58006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, <b class=verse-num id=v58006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v58006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And this we will do if God permits. <b class=verse-num id=v58006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, <b class=verse-num id=v58006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, <b class=verse-num id=v58006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt. <b class=verse-num id=v58006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. <b class=verse-num id=v58006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.</p><p id=p58006008_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v58006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things&#8212;things that belong to salvation. <b class=verse-num id=v58006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do. <b class=verse-num id=v58006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end, <b class=verse-num id=v58006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p><h3 id=p58006012_01-1>The Certainty of God&#8217;s Promise</h3><p id=p58006012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v58006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, <b class=verse-num id=v58006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Surely I will bless you and multiply you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise. <b class=verse-num id=v58006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. <b class=verse-num id=v58006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, <b class=verse-num id=v58006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. <b class=verse-num id=v58006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain, <b class=verse-num id=v58006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p></div>

He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. <b class=verse-num id=v58007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.</p><p id=p58007003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! <b class=verse-num id=v58007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v58007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. <b class=verse-num id=v58007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. <b class=verse-num id=v58007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. <b class=verse-num id=v58007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, <b class=verse-num id=v58007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</p><h3 id=p58007010_06-1>Jesus Compared to Melchizedek</h3><p id=p58007010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron? <b class=verse-num id=v58007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. <b class=verse-num id=v58007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v58007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</p><p id=p58007014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, <b class=verse-num id=v58007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. <b class=verse-num id=v58007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For it is witnessed of him,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58007017_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You are a priest forever,</span><br /><span id=p58007017_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58007017_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness <b class=verse-num id=v58007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>(for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</p><p id=p58007019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, <b class=verse-num id=v58007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58007021_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The Lord has sworn</span><br /><span id=p58007021_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will not change his mind,</span><br /><span id=p58007021_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8216;You are a priest forever.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58007021_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.</p><p id=p58007022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, <b class=verse-num id=v58007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. <b class=verse-num id=v58007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</p><p id=p58007025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. <b class=verse-num id=v58007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. <b class=verse-num id=v58007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</p></div>

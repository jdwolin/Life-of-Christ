He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin, but he walked in them. <b class=verse-num id=v12013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, and the might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v12013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</p><h3 id=p12013013_09-1>The Death of Elisha</h3><p id=p12013013_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash king of Israel went down to him and wept before him, crying, &#8220;My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Take a bow and arrows.&#8221; So he took a bow and arrows. <b class=verse-num id=v12013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then he said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Draw the bow,&#8221; and he drew it. And Elisha laid his hands on the king&#8217;s hands. <b class=verse-num id=v12013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Open the window eastward,&#8221; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, &#8220;Shoot,&#8221; and he shot. And he said, &#8220;The LORD&#8217;s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Take the arrows,&#8221; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Strike the ground with them.&#8221; And he struck three times and stopped. <b class=verse-num id=v12013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the man of God was angry with him and said, &#8220;You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only three times.&#8221;</p><p id=p12013019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year. <b class=verse-num id=v12013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And as a man was being buried, behold, a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha, and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.</p><p id=p12013021_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Now Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. <b class=verse-num id=v12013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them, and he turned toward them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, nor has he cast them from his presence until now.</p><p id=p12013023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When Hazael king of Syria died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v12013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities that he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.</p></div>

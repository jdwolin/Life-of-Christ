So the name of the place was called Hormah.</p><h3 id=p04021003_03-1>The Bronze Serpent</h3><p id=p04021003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. <b class=verse-num id=v04021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the people spoke against God and against Moses, &#8220;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. <b class=verse-num id=v04021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the people came to Moses and said, &#8220;We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.&#8221; So Moses prayed for the people. <b class=verse-num id=v04021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.</p><h3 id=p04021009_06-1>The Song of the Well</h3><p id=p04021009_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth. <b class=verse-num id=v04021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise. <b class=verse-num id=v04021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered. <b class=verse-num id=v04021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <b class=verse-num id=v04021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p04021014_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,</span><br /><span id=p04021015_11-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the slope of the valleys</span><br /><span id=p04021015_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;that extends to the seat of Ar,</span><br /><span id=p04021015_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and leans to the border of Moab.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p04021015_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Gather the people together, so that I may give them water.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Israel sang this song:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p04021017_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Spring up, O well!&#8212;Sing to it!&#8212;</span><br /><span id=p04021018_11-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;the well that the princes made,</span><br /><span id=p04021018_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;that the nobles of the people dug,</span><br /><span id=p04021018_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;with the scepter and with their staffs.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p04021018_11-1 class=same-paragraph>And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah, <b class=verse-num id=v04021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, <b class=verse-num id=v04021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert.</p><h3 id=p04021020_11-1>King Sihon Defeated</h3><p id=p04021020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let me pass through your land.

He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong. <b class=verse-num id=v04021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. <b class=verse-num id=v04021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. <b class=verse-num id=v04021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Therefore the ballad singers say,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p04021027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Come to Heshbon, let it be built;</span><br /><span id=p04021027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the city of Sihon be established.</span><br /><span id=p04021028_14-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For fire came out from Heshbon,</span><br /><span id=p04021028_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flame from the city of Sihon.</span><br /><span id=p04021028_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;It devoured Ar of Moab,</span><br /><span id=p04021028_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and swallowed the heights of the Arnon.</span><br /><span id=p04021029_14-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to you, O Moab!</span><br /><span id=p04021029_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are undone, O people of Chemosh!</span><br /><span id=p04021029_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made his sons fugitives,</span><br /><span id=p04021029_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his daughters captives,</span><br /><span id=p04021029_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to an Amorite king, Sihon.</span><br /><span id=p04021030_14-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v04021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So we overthrew them;</span><br /><span id=p04021030_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heshbon, as far as Dibon, perished;</span><br /><span id=p04021030_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we laid waste as far as Nophah;</span><br /><span id=p04021030_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire spread as far as Medeba.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p04021030_14-1>King Og Defeated</h3><p id=p04021030_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v04021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. <b class=verse-num id=v04021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there. <b class=verse-num id=v04021033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan.

<h3 id=p04022001_01-1>Balak Summons Balaam</h3><p id=p04022001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v04022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v04022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. <b class=verse-num id=v04022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were many. Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Moab said to the elders of Midian, &#8220;This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.&#8221; So Balak the son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, <b class=verse-num id=v04022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the people of Amaw, to call him, saying, &#8220;Behold, a people has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me. <b class=verse-num id=v04022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.&#8221;</p><p id=p04022006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and gave him Balak&#8217;s message. <b class=verse-num id=v04022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the LORD speaks to me.&#8221; So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. <b class=verse-num id=v04022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And God came to Balaam and said, &#8220;Who are these men with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Balaam said to God, &#8220;Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the earth. Now come, curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>God said to Balaam, &#8220;You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, &#8220;Go to your own land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak and said, &#8220;Balaam refuses to come with us.&#8221;</p><p id=p04022014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Once again Balak sent princes, more in number and more honorable than these. <b class=verse-num id=v04022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they came to Balaam and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: &#8216;Let nothing hinder you from coming to me, <b class=verse-num id=v04022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Come, curse this people for me.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, &#8220;Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD my God to do less or more. <b class=verse-num id=v04022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So you, too, please stay here tonight, that I may know what more the LORD will say to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, &#8220;If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only do what I tell you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.</p><h3 id=p04022021_04-1>Balaam&#8217;s Donkey and the Angel</h3><p id=p04022021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But God&#8217;s anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v04022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the road. <b class=verse-num id=v04022024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side. <b class=verse-num id=v04022025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam&#8217;s foot against the wall. So he struck her again. <b class=verse-num id=v04022026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left. <b class=verse-num id=v04022027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam&#8217;s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff. <b class=verse-num id=v04022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &#8220;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Balaam said to the donkey, &#8220;Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the donkey said to Balaam, &#8220;Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p><p id=p04022030_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face. <b class=verse-num id=v04022032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to him, &#8220;Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me. <b class=verse-num id=v04022033-1>33&nbsp;</b>The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, &#8220;I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, &#8220;Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you.&#8221; So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.</p><p id=p04022035_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022036-1>36&nbsp;</b>When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border. <b class=verse-num id=v04022037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And Balak said to Balaam, &#8220;Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Balaam said to Balak, &#8220;Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04022039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. <b class=verse-num id=v04022040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him.</p><p id=p04022040_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04022041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people.</p></div>

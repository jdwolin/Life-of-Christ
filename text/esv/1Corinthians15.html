<h3 id=p46014001_01-1>Prophecy and Tongues</h3><p id=p46014001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. <b class=verse-num id=v46014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v46014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. <b class=verse-num id=v46014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. <b class=verse-num id=v46014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.</p><p id=p46014005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? <b class=verse-num id=v46014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? <b class=verse-num id=v46014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? <b class=verse-num id=v46014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. <b class=verse-num id=v46014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, <b class=verse-num id=v46014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. <b class=verse-num id=v46014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</p><p id=p46014012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. <b class=verse-num id=v46014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. <b class=verse-num id=v46014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. <b class=verse-num id=v46014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? <b class=verse-num id=v46014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. <b class=verse-num id=v46014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <b class=verse-num id=v46014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p><p id=p46014019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. <b class=verse-num id=v46014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In the Law it is written, &#8220;By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. <b class=verse-num id=v46014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? <b class=verse-num id=v46014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, <b class=verse-num id=v46014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</p><h3 id=p46014025_04-1>Orderly Worship</h3><p id=p46014025_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. <b class=verse-num id=v46014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. <b class=verse-num id=v46014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. <b class=verse-num id=v46014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. <b class=verse-num id=v46014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. <b class=verse-num id=v46014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, <b class=verse-num id=v46014032-1>32&nbsp;</b>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v46014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</p><p id=p46014033_06-1>As in all the churches of the saints, <b class=verse-num id=v46014034-1>34&nbsp;</b>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. <b class=verse-num id=v46014035-1>35&nbsp;</b>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</p><p id=p46014035_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46014036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? <b class=verse-num id=v46014037-1>37&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46014038-1>38&nbsp;</b>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. <b class=verse-num id=v46014039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <b class=verse-num id=v46014040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But all things should be done decently and in order.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46015001_01-1>The Resurrection of Christ</h3><p id=p46015001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, <b class=verse-num id=v46015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you&#8212;unless you believed in vain.</p><p id=p46015002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <b class=verse-num id=v46015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, <b class=verse-num id=v46015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. <b class=verse-num id=v46015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. <b class=verse-num id=v46015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. <b class=verse-num id=v46015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. <b class=verse-num id=v46015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. <b class=verse-num id=v46015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</p><h3 id=p46015011_05-1>The Resurrection of the Dead</h3><p id=p46015011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <b class=verse-num id=v46015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. <b class=verse-num id=v46015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. <b class=verse-num id=v46015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. <b class=verse-num id=v46015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. <b class=verse-num id=v46015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. <b class=verse-num id=v46015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. <b class=verse-num id=v46015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p><p id=p46015019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <b class=verse-num id=v46015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v46015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. <b class=verse-num id=v46015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. <b class=verse-num id=v46015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <b class=verse-num id=v46015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The last enemy to be destroyed is death. <b class=verse-num id=v46015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For &#8220;God has put all things in subjection under his feet.&#8221; But when it says, &#8220;all things are put in subjection,&#8221; it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. <b class=verse-num id=v46015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.</p><p id=p46015028_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf? <b class=verse-num id=v46015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Why are we in danger every hour? <b class=verse-num id=v46015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day! <b class=verse-num id=v46015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, &#8220;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Do not be deceived: &#8220;Bad company ruins good morals.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</p><h3 id=p46015034_10-1>The Resurrection Body</h3><p id=p46015034_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But someone will ask, &#8220;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. <b class=verse-num id=v46015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. <b class=verse-num id=v46015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. <b class=verse-num id=v46015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. <b class=verse-num id=v46015040-1>40&nbsp;</b>There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another. <b class=verse-num id=v46015041-1>41&nbsp;</b>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</p><p id=p46015041_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015042-1>42&nbsp;</b>So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. <b class=verse-num id=v46015043-1>43&nbsp;</b>It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. <b class=verse-num id=v46015044-1>44&nbsp;</b>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <b class=verse-num id=v46015045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Thus it is written, &#8220;The first man Adam became a living being&#8221;; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v46015046-1>46&nbsp;</b>But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual. <b class=verse-num id=v46015047-1>47&nbsp;</b>The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v46015048-1>48&nbsp;</b>As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v46015049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</p><h3 id=p46015049_13-1>Mystery and Victory</h3><p id=p46015049_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015050-1>50&nbsp;</b>I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <b class=verse-num id=v46015051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, <b class=verse-num id=v46015052-1>52&nbsp;</b>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. <b class=verse-num id=v46015053-1>53&nbsp;</b>For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. <b class=verse-num id=v46015054-1>54&nbsp;</b>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p46015054_16-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Death is swallowed up in victory.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p46015055_16-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v46015055-1>55&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;O death, where is your victory?</span><br /><span id=p46015055_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O death, where is your sting?&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p46015055_16-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v46015056-1>56&nbsp;</b>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. <b class=verse-num id=v46015057-1>57&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p id=p46015057_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v46015058-1>58&nbsp;</b>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14007001_01-1>Fire from Heaven</h3><p id=p14007001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v14007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v14007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, &#8220;For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14007003_04-1>The Dedication of the Temple</h3><p id=p14007003_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>King Solomon offered as a sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. <b class=verse-num id=v14007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD&#8212;for his steadfast love endures forever&#8212;whenever David offered praises by their ministry; opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood.</p><p id=p14007006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat.</p><p id=p14007007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v14007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v14007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity that the LORD had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.</p><h3 id=p14007010_09-1>If My People Pray</h3><p id=p14007010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king&#8217;s house. All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house he successfully accomplished. <b class=verse-num id=v14007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: &#8220;I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v14007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people, <b class=verse-num id=v14007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land. <b class=verse-num id=v14007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place. <b class=verse-num id=v14007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time. <b class=verse-num id=v14007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules, <b class=verse-num id=v14007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, &#8216;You shall not lack a man to rule Israel.&#8217;</p><p id=p14007018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, <b class=verse-num id=v14007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>then I will pluck you up from my land that I have given you, and this house that I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <b class=verse-num id=v14007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, &#8216;Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v14007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then they will say, &#8216;Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p14009001_01-1>The Queen of Sheba</h3><p id=p14009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind. <b class=verse-num id=v14009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her. <b class=verse-num id=v14009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, <b class=verse-num id=v14009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.</p><p id=p14009004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And she said to the king, &#8220;The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom, <b class=verse-num id=v14009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report that I heard. <b class=verse-num id=v14009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! <b class=verse-num id=v14009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</p><p id=p14009009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones. <b class=verse-num id=v14009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the king made from the algum wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king&#8217;s house, lyres also and harps for the singers. There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.</p><p id=p14009011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.</p><h3 id=p14009012_05-1>Solomon&#8217;s Wealth</h3><p id=p14009012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, <b class=verse-num id=v14009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>besides that which the explorers and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon. <b class=verse-num id=v14009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of beaten gold went into each shield. <b class=verse-num id=v14009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; 300 shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. <b class=verse-num id=v14009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests, <b class=verse-num id=v14009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v14009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>All King Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold.

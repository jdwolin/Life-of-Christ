<h3 id=p11018001_01-1>Elijah Confronts Ahab</h3><p id=p11018001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, &#8220;Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v11018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <b class=verse-num id=v11018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <b class=verse-num id=v11018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said to Obadiah, &#8220;Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.</p><p id=p11018006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, &#8220;Is it you, my lord Elijah?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he answered him, &#8220;It is I. Go, tell your lord, &#8216;Behold, Elijah is here.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <b class=verse-num id=v11018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, &#8216;He is not here,&#8217; he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. <b class=verse-num id=v11018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now you say, &#8216;Go, tell your lord, &#8220;Behold, Elijah is here.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth. <b class=verse-num id=v11018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD&#8217;s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water? <b class=verse-num id=v11018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And now you say, &#8216;Go, tell your lord, &#8220;Behold, Elijah is here&#8221;&#8217;; and he will kill me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said, &#8220;As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p><p id=p11018016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, &#8220;Is it you, you troubler of Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he answered, &#8220;I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father&#8217;s house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals. <b class=verse-num id=v11018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel&#8217;s table.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p11018019_04-1>The Prophets of Baal Defeated</h3><p id=p11018019_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. <b class=verse-num id=v11018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Elijah came near to all the people and said, &#8220;How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.&#8221; And the people did not answer him a word. <b class=verse-num id=v11018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the people, &#8220;I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal&#8217;s prophets are 450 men. <b class=verse-num id=v11018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it. <b class=verse-num id=v11018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, he is God.&#8221; And all the people answered, &#8220;It is well spoken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, &#8220;Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, &#8220;O Baal, answer us!&#8221; But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. <b class=verse-num id=v11018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, &#8220;Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v11018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.</p><p id=p11018029_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to all the people, &#8220;Come near to me.&#8221; And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down. <b class=verse-num id=v11018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, &#8220;Israel shall be your name,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <b class=verse-num id=v11018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, &#8220;Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Do it a second time.&#8221; And they did it a second time. And he said, &#8220;Do it a third time.&#8221; And they did it a third time. <b class=verse-num id=v11018035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p><p id=p11018035_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, &#8220;O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <b class=verse-num id=v11018037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <b class=verse-num id=v11018039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, &#8220;The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to them, &#8220;Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.&#8221; And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.</p><h3 id=p11018040_09-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Sends Rain</h3><p id=p11018040_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v11018041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to Ahab, &#8220;Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018042-1>42&nbsp;</b>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees. <b class=verse-num id=v11018043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he said to his servant, &#8220;Go up now, look toward the sea.&#8221; And he went up and looked and said, &#8220;There is nothing.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Go again,&#8221; seven times. <b class=verse-num id=v11018044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And at the seventh time he said, &#8220;Behold, a little cloud like a man&#8217;s hand is rising from the sea.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Go up, say to Ahab, &#8216;Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11018045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. <b class=verse-num id=v11018046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he gathered up his garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p></div>

And he asked that he might die, saying, &#8220;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, &#8220;Arise and eat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. <b class=verse-num id=v11019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, &#8220;Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.</p><h3 id=p11019008_04-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Speaks to Elijah</h3><p id=p11019008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>There he came to a cave and lodged in it.

And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <b class=verse-num id=v11019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. <b class=verse-num id=v11019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.

Thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and closed in on Samaria and fought against it. <b class=verse-num id=v11020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Ben-hadad: <b class=verse-num id=v11020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Your silver and your gold are mine; your best wives and children also are mine.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel answered, &#8220;As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The messengers came again and said, &#8220;Thus says Ben-hadad: &#8216;I sent to you, saying, &#8220;Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p11020006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, &#8220;Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And all the elders and all the people said to him, &#8220;Do not listen or consent.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, &#8220;Tell my lord the king, &#8216;All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this thing I cannot do.&#8217;&#8221; And the messengers departed and brought him word again. <b class=verse-num id=v11020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Ben-hadad sent to him and said, &#8220;The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel answered, &#8220;Tell him, &#8216;Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, &#8220;Take your positions.&#8221; And they took their positions against the city.</p><h3 id=p11020012_05-1>Ahab Defeats Ben-hadad</h3><p id=p11020012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude?

The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country. <b class=verse-num id=v11020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because the Syrians have said, &#8220;The LORD is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys,&#8221; therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And they encamped opposite one another seven days.

Perhaps he will spare your life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So they tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said, &#8220;Your servant Ben-hadad says, &#8216;Please, let me live.&#8217;&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Does he still live? He is my brother.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now the men were watching for a sign, and they quickly took it up from him and said, &#8220;Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Go and bring him.&#8221; Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot. <b class=verse-num id=v11020034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Ben-hadad said to him, &#8220;The cities that my father took from your father I will restore, and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.&#8221; And Ahab said, &#8220;I will let you go on these terms.&#8221; So he made a covenant with him and let him go.</p><h3 id=p11020034_12-1>A Prophet Condemns Ben-hadad&#8217;s Release</h3><p id=p11020034_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the LORD, &#8220;Strike me, please.&#8221; But the man refused to strike him. <b class=verse-num id=v11020036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then he said to him, &#8220;Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down.&#8221; And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and struck him down. <b class=verse-num id=v11020037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then he found another man and said, &#8220;Strike me, please.&#8221; And the man struck him&#8212;struck him and wounded him. <b class=verse-num id=v11020038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v11020039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, &#8220;Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said, &#8216;Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11020040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.&#8221; The king of Israel said to him, &#8220;So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v11020042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10003001_01-1>Abner Joins David</h3><p id=p10003001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.</p><p id=p10003001_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel; <b class=verse-num id=v10003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <b class=verse-num id=v10003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <b class=verse-num id=v10003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David&#8217;s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</p><p id=p10003005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v10003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, &#8220;Why have you gone in to my father&#8217;s concubine?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, &#8220;Am I a dog&#8217;s head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman. <b class=verse-num id=v10003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him, <b class=verse-num id=v10003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</p><p id=p10003011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, &#8220;To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, when you come to see my face.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, saying, &#8220;Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish. <b class=verse-num id=v10003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, &#8220;Go, return.&#8221; And he returned.</p><p id=p10003016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, &#8220;For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you. <b class=verse-num id=v10003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now then bring it about, for the LORD has promised David, saying, &#8216;By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Abner also spoke to Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.</p><p id=p10003019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Abner said to David, &#8220;I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.&#8221; So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</p><p id=p10003021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. <b class=verse-num id=v10003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, &#8220;Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then Joab went to the king and said, &#8220;What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone? <b class=verse-num id=v10003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10003025_04-1>Joab Murders Abner</h3><p id=p10003025_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Joab came out from David&#8217;s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it. <b class=verse-num id=v10003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v10003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, &#8220;I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner. <b class=verse-num id=v10003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father&#8217;s house, and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or who is leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.</p><h3 id=p10003030_07-1>David Mourns Abner</h3><p id=p10003030_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10003031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, &#8220;Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.&#8221; And King David followed the bier. <b class=verse-num id=v10003032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. <b class=verse-num id=v10003033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the king lamented for Abner, saying,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p10003033_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Should Abner die as a fool dies?</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v10003034-1>34&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hands were not bound;</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your feet were not fettered;</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;as one falls before the wicked</span><br /><span id=p10003034_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have fallen.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p10003034_10-1 class=same-paragraph>And all the people wept again over him. <b class=verse-num id=v10003035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day. But David swore, saying, &#8220;God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10003036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people. <b class=verse-num id=v10003037-1>37&nbsp;</b>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king&#8217;s will to put to death Abner the son of Ner. <b class=verse-num id=v10003038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And the king said to his servants, &#8220;Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v10003039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And I was gentle today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. The LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!&#8221;</p></div>

He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p><p id=p10004004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest. <b class=verse-num id=v10004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v10004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him. They took his head and went by the way of the Arabah all night, <b class=verse-num id=v10004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, &#8220;Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, &#8220;As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity, <b class=verse-num id=v10004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>when one told me, &#8216;Behold, Saul is dead,&#8217; and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. <b class=verse-num id=v10004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.</p></div>

And the LORD said to you, &#8216;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v10005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</p><p id=p10005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, &#8220;You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off&#8221;&#8212;thinking, &#8220;David cannot come in here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. <b class=verse-num id=v10005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David said on that day, &#8220;Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack &#8216;the lame and the blind,&#8217; who are hated by David&#8217;s soul.&#8221; Therefore it is said, &#8220;The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward. <b class=verse-num id=v10005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.</p><p id=p10005010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house. <b class=verse-num id=v10005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David knew that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p><p id=p10005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David. <b class=verse-num id=v10005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <b class=verse-num id=v10005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, <b class=verse-num id=v10005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p><h3 id=p10005016_06-1>David Defeats the Philistines</h3><p id=p10005016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold. <b class=verse-num id=v10005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And David inquired of the LORD, &#8220;Shall I go up against the Philistines?

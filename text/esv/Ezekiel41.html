<h3 id=p26040001_01-1>Vision of the New Temple</h3><p id=p26040001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26040001-1>40:1&nbsp;</b>In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to the city. <b class=verse-num id=v26040002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south. <b class=verse-num id=v26040003-1>3&nbsp;</b>When he brought me there, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway. <b class=verse-num id=v26040004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the man said to me, &#8220;Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26040004_06-1>The East Gate to the Outer Court</h3><p id=p26040004_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And behold, there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man&#8217;s hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26040006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. <b class=verse-num id=v26040007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the side rooms, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26040008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, on the inside, one reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26040009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end. <b class=verse-num id=v26040010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate. The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size. <b class=verse-num id=v26040011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040012-1>12&nbsp;</b>There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side. And the side rooms were six cubits on either side. <b class=verse-num id=v26040013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the gate from the ceiling of the one side room to the ceiling of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; the openings faced each other. <b class=verse-num id=v26040014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He measured also the vestibule, sixty cubits. And around the vestibule of the gateway was the court. <b class=verse-num id=v26040015-1>15&nbsp;</b>From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the gateway had windows all around, narrowing inwards toward the side rooms and toward their jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around inside, and on the jambs were palm trees.</p><h3 id=p26040016_13-1>The Outer Court</h3><p id=p26040016_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me into the outer court. And behold, there were chambers and a pavement, all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement. <b class=verse-num id=v26040018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement. <b class=verse-num id=v26040019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side.</p><h3 id=p26040019_16-1>The North Gate</h3><p id=p26040019_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As for the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth. <b class=verse-num id=v26040021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. And by seven steps people would go up to it, and find its vestibule before them. <b class=verse-num id=v26040023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.</p><h3 id=p26040023_19-1>The South Gate</h3><p id=p26040023_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south. And he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others. <b class=verse-num id=v26040025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Both it and its vestibule had windows all around, like the windows of the others. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was before them, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side. <b class=verse-num id=v26040027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there was a gate on the south of the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.</p><h3 id=p26040027_22-1>The Inner Court</h3><p id=p26040027_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate. It was of the same size as the others. <b class=verse-num id=v26040029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And there were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad. <b class=verse-num id=v26040031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps.</p><p id=p26040031_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate. It was of the same size as the others. <b class=verse-num id=v26040033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.</p><p id=p26040034_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it. It had the same size as the others. <b class=verse-num id=v26040036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and it had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26040037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.</p><p id=p26040037_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040038-1>38&nbsp;</b>There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed. <b class=verse-num id=v26040039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered. <b class=verse-num id=v26040040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and off to the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables. <b class=verse-num id=v26040041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, on which to slaughter. <b class=verse-num id=v26040042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered. <b class=verse-num id=v26040043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.</p><h3 id=p26040043_25-1>Chambers for the Priests</h3><p id=p26040043_29-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040044-1>44&nbsp;</b>On the outside of the inner gateway there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north. <b class=verse-num id=v26040045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple, <b class=verse-num id=v26040046-1>46&nbsp;</b>and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26040047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad, a square. And the altar was in front of the temple.</p><h3 id=p26040047_29-1>The Vestibule of the Temple</h3><p id=p26040047_34-1><b class=verse-num id=v26040048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side. And the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side. <b class=verse-num id=v26040049-1>49&nbsp;</b>The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits, and people would go up to it by ten steps.

<h3 id=p26041001_01-1>The Inner Temple</h3><p id=p26041001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26041001-1>41:1&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the nave and measured the jambs. On each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs. <b class=verse-num id=v26041002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26041003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side of the entrance, seven cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26041004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across the nave. And he said to me, &#8220;This is the Most Holy Place.&#8221;</p><p id=p26041004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v26041006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v26041007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story. <b class=verse-num id=v26041008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26041009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The free space between the side chambers of the temple and the <b class=verse-num id=v26041010-1>10&nbsp;</b>other chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side. <b class=verse-num id=v26041011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the doors of the side chambers opened on the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.</p><p id=p26041011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The building that was facing the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</p><p id=p26041012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long; <b class=verse-num id=v26041014-1>14&nbsp;</b>also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.</p><p id=p26041014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard that was at the back and its galleries on either side, a hundred cubits.</p><p id=p26041015_04-1>The inside of the nave and the vestibules of the court, <b class=verse-num id=v26041016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the thresholds and the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered), <b class=verse-num id=v26041017-1>17&nbsp;</b>to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern. <b class=verse-num id=v26041018-1>18&nbsp;</b>It was carved of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces: <b class=verse-num id=v26041019-1>19&nbsp;</b>a human face toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26041020-1>20&nbsp;</b>From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; similarly the wall of the nave.</p><p id=p26041020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The doorposts of the nave were squared, and in front of the Holy Place was something resembling <b class=verse-num id=v26041022-1>22&nbsp;</b>an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, &#8220;This is the table that is before the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26041023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The nave and the Holy Place had each a double door. <b class=verse-num id=v26041024-1>24&nbsp;</b>The double doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door. <b class=verse-num id=v26041025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls. And there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside. <b class=verse-num id=v26041026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, the side chambers of the temple, and the canopies.</p></div>

They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors, <b class=verse-num id=v26042012-1>12&nbsp;</b>as were the entrances of the chambers on the south.

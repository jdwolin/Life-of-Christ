The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So the people rested on the seventh day.</p><p id=p02016030_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. <b class=verse-num id=v02016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded: &#8216;Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. <b class=verse-num id=v02016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land.

It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. <b class=verse-num id=v14004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Under it were figures of gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. <b class=verse-num id=v14004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward. <b class=verse-num id=v14004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Its thickness was a handbreadth. And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held 3,000 baths. <b class=verse-num id=v14004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.</p><p id=p14004006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v14004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v14004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.</p><p id=p14004010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God: <b class=verse-num id=v14004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; <b class=verse-num id=v14004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and the 400 pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars. <b class=verse-num id=v14004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He made the stands also, and the basins on the stands, <b class=verse-num id=v14004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it. <b class=verse-num id=v14004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. <b class=verse-num id=v14004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Solomon made all these things in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze was not sought.</p><p id=p14004018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence, <b class=verse-num id=v14004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed; <b class=verse-num id=v14004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold; <b class=verse-num id=v14004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold, and the sockets of the temple, for the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.</p></div>

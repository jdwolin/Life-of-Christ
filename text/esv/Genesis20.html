<h3 id=p01019001_01-1>God Rescues Lot</h3><p id=p01019001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth <b class=verse-num id=v01019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;My lords, please turn aside to your servant&#8217;s house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No; we will spend the night in the town square.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</p><p id=p01019003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. <b class=verse-num id=v01019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they called to Lot, &#8220;Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him, <b class=verse-num id=v01019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. <b class=verse-num id=v01019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But they said, &#8220;Stand back!&#8221; And they said, &#8220;This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.&#8221; Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. <b class=verse-num id=v01019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. <b class=verse-num id=v01019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.</p><p id=p01019011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the men said to Lot, &#8220;Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. <b class=verse-num id=v01019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, &#8220;Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city.&#8221; But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.</p><p id=p01019014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, &#8220;Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. <b class=verse-num id=v01019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And as they brought them out, one said, &#8220;Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Lot said to them, &#8220;Oh, no, my lords. <b class=verse-num id=v01019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. <b class=verse-num id=v01019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there&#8212;is it not a little one?&#8212;and my life will be saved!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He said to him, &#8220;Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. <b class=verse-num id=v01019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there.&#8221; Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p><h3 id=p01019022_04-1>God Destroys Sodom</h3><p id=p01019022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. <b class=verse-num id=v01019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v01019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Lot&#8217;s wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</p><p id=p01019026_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.</p><p id=p01019028_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.</p><h3 id=p01019029_07-1>Lot and His Daughters</h3><p id=p01019029_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. <b class=verse-num id=v01019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the firstborn said to the younger, &#8220;Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v01019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</p><p id=p01019033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, &#8220;Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. <b class=verse-num id=v01019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. <b class=verse-num id=v01019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v01019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01020001_01-1>Abraham and Abimelech</h3><p id=p01020001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01020001-1>20:1&nbsp;</b>From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. <b class=verse-num id=v01020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. <b class=verse-num id=v01020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, &#8220;Lord, will you kill an innocent people? <b class=verse-num id=v01020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Did he not himself say to me, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;? And she herself said, &#8216;He is my brother.&#8217; In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then God said to him in the dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. <b class=verse-num id=v01020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now then, return the man&#8217;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.&#8221;</p><p id=p01020007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v01020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &#8220;What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What did you see, that you did this thing?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Abraham said, &#8220;I did it because I thought, &#8216;There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when God caused me to wander from my father&#8217;s house, I said to her, &#8216;This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, &#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01020013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said, &#8220;Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>To Sarah he said, &#8220;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. <b class=verse-num id=v01020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham&#8217;s wife.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01021001_01-1>The Birth of Isaac</h3><p id=p01021001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01021001-1>21:1&nbsp;</b>The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. <b class=verse-num id=v01021002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01021003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v01021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <b class=verse-num id=v01021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Sarah said, &#8220;God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01021007_05-1>God Protects Hagar and Ishmael</h3><p id=p01021007_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. <b class=verse-num id=v01021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing. <b class=verse-num id=v01021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So she said to Abraham, &#8220;Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But God said to Abraham, &#8220;Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. <b class=verse-num id=v01021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p><p id=p01021014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. <b class=verse-num id=v01021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, &#8220;Let me not look on the death of the child.&#8221; And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. <b class=verse-num id=v01021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, &#8220;What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. <b class=verse-num id=v01021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. <b class=verse-num id=v01021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. <b class=verse-num id=v01021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</p><h3 id=p01021021_10-1>A Treaty with Abimelech</h3><p id=p01021021_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, &#8220;God is with you in all that you do. <b class=verse-num id=v01021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Abraham said, &#8220;I will swear.&#8221;</p><p id=p01021024_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v01021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech&#8217;s servants had seized, <b class=verse-num id=v01021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Abimelech said, &#8220;I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v01021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. <b class=verse-num id=v01021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath. <b class=verse-num id=v01021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v01021033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. <b class=verse-num id=v01021034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.</p></div>

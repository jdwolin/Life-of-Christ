<h3 id=p46009001_01-1>Paul Surrenders His Rights</h3><p id=p46009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord? <b class=verse-num id=v46009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</p><p id=p46009002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>This is my defense to those who would examine me. <b class=verse-num id=v46009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Do we not have the right to eat and drink? <b class=verse-num id=v46009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? <b class=verse-num id=v46009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? <b class=verse-num id=v46009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?</p><p id=p46009007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same? <b class=verse-num id=v46009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For it is written in the Law of Moses, &#8220;You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.&#8221; Is it for oxen that God is concerned? <b class=verse-num id=v46009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop. <b class=verse-num id=v46009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? <b class=verse-num id=v46009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more?</p><p id=p46009012_05-1>Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings? <b class=verse-num id=v46009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.</p><p id=p46009014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting. <b class=verse-num id=v46009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! <b class=verse-num id=v46009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship. <b class=verse-num id=v46009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.</p><p id=p46009018_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. <b class=verse-num id=v46009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. <b class=verse-num id=v46009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. <b class=verse-num id=v46009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. <b class=verse-num id=v46009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.</p><p id=p46009023_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. <b class=verse-num id=v46009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. <b class=verse-num id=v46009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. <b class=verse-num id=v46009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46010001_01-1>Warning Against Idolatry</h3><p id=p46010001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v46010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v46010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and all ate the same spiritual food, <b class=verse-num id=v46010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</p><p id=p46010005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. <b class=verse-num id=v46010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, &#8220;The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. <b class=verse-num id=v46010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, <b class=verse-num id=v46010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer. <b class=verse-num id=v46010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. <b class=verse-num id=v46010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. <b class=verse-num id=v46010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</p><p id=p46010013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. <b class=verse-num id=v46010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. <b class=verse-num id=v46010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? <b class=verse-num id=v46010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. <b class=verse-num id=v46010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? <b class=verse-num id=v46010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <b class=verse-num id=v46010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. <b class=verse-num id=v46010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. <b class=verse-num id=v46010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p><h3 id=p46010022_04-1>Do All to the Glory of God</h3><p id=p46010022_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;All things are lawful,&#8221; but not all things are helpful. &#8220;All things are lawful,&#8221; but not all things build up. <b class=verse-num id=v46010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor. <b class=verse-num id=v46010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v46010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For &#8220;the earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the fullness thereof.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v46010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But if someone says to you, &#8220;This has been offered in sacrifice,&#8221; then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else&#8217;s conscience? <b class=verse-num id=v46010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?</p><p id=p46010030_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v46010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, <b class=verse-num id=v46010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.</p></div>

<p id=p46011001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.</p><h3 id=p46011001_01-1>Head Coverings</h3><p id=p46011001_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. <b class=verse-num id=v46011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. <b class=verse-num id=v46011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, <b class=verse-num id=v46011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. <b class=verse-num id=v46011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. <b class=verse-num id=v46011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <b class=verse-num id=v46011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; <b class=verse-num id=v46011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. <b class=verse-num id=v46011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? <b class=verse-num id=v46011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, <b class=verse-num id=v46011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. <b class=verse-num id=v46011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p><h3 id=p46011016_03-1>The Lord&#8217;s Supper</h3><p id=p46011016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. <b class=verse-num id=v46011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <b class=verse-num id=v46011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. <b class=verse-num id=v46011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When you come together, it is not the Lord&#8217;s supper that you eat. <b class=verse-num id=v46011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=verse-num id=v46011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p><p id=p46011022_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, <b class=verse-num id=v46011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v46011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v46011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes.</p><p id=p46011026_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. <b class=verse-num id=v46011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. <b class=verse-num id=v46011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. <b class=verse-num id=v46011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. <b class=verse-num id=v46011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p><p id=p46011032_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home&#8212;so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p></div>

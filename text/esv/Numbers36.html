And you shall give to the Levites pasturelands around the cities. <b class=verse-num id=v04035003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The cities shall be theirs to dwell in, and their pasturelands shall be for their cattle and for their livestock and for all their beasts. <b class=verse-num id=v04035004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The pasturelands of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around. <b class=verse-num id=v04035005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And you shall measure, outside the city, on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the middle. This shall belong to them as pastureland for their cities.</p><p id=p04035005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v04035006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The cities that you give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, where you shall permit the manslayer to flee, and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities. <b class=verse-num id=v04035007-1>7&nbsp;</b>All the cities that you give to the Levites shall be forty-eight, with their pasturelands. <b class=verse-num id=v04035008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And as for the cities that you shall give from the possession of the people of Israel, from the larger tribes you shall take many, and from the smaller tribes you shall take few; each, in proportion to the inheritance that it inherits, shall give of its cities to the Levites.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p04035008_05-1>Cities of Refuge</h3><p id=p04035008_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v04035009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04035010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, <b class=verse-num id=v04035011-1>11&nbsp;</b>then you shall select cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person without intent may flee there. <b class=verse-num id=v04035012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The cities shall be for you a refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v04035013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the cities that you give shall be your six cities of refuge. <b class=verse-num id=v04035014-1>14&nbsp;</b>You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities in the land of Canaan, to be cities of refuge. <b class=verse-num id=v04035015-1>15&nbsp;</b>These six cities shall be for refuge for the people of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills any person without intent may flee there.</p><p id=p04035015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v04035016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v04035017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And if he struck him down with a stone tool that could cause death, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v04035018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Or if he struck him down with a wooden tool that could cause death, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v04035019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death. <b class=verse-num id=v04035020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And if he pushed him out of hatred or hurled something at him, lying in wait, so that he died, <b class=verse-num id=v04035021-1>21&nbsp;</b>or in enmity struck him down with his hand, so that he died, then he who struck the blow shall be put to death.

But no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness. <b class=verse-num id=v04035031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Moreover, you shall accept no ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, but he shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v04035032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And you shall accept no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the high priest. <b class=verse-num id=v04035033-1>33&nbsp;</b>You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it. <b class=verse-num id=v04035034-1>34&nbsp;</b>You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell, for I the LORD dwell in the midst of the people of Israel.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p55003001_01-1>Godlessness in the Last Days</h3><p id=p55003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v55003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. <b class=verse-num id=v55003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <b class=verse-num id=v55003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, <b class=verse-num id=v55003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <b class=verse-num id=v55003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. <b class=verse-num id=v55003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, <b class=verse-num id=v55003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v55003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. <b class=verse-num id=v55003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.</p><h3 id=p55003009_06-1>All Scripture Is Breathed Out by God</h3><p id=p55003009_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v55003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, <b class=verse-num id=v55003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra&#8212;which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. <b class=verse-num id=v55003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, <b class=verse-num id=v55003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. <b class=verse-num id=v55003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it <b class=verse-num id=v55003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v55003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, <b class=verse-num id=v55003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</p></div>

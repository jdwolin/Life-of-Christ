His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v12014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father. He did in all things as Joash his father had done. <b class=verse-num id=v12014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. <b class=verse-num id=v12014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand, he struck down his servants who had struck down the king his father. <b class=verse-num id=v12014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he did not put to death the children of the murderers, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, &#8220;Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers. But each one shall die for his own sin.&#8221;</p><p id=p12014006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by storm, and called it Joktheel, which is its name to this day.</p><p id=p12014007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Come, let us look one another in the face.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jehoash king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, &#8220;A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son for a wife,&#8217; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. <b class=verse-num id=v12014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You have indeed struck down Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home, for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?&#8221;</p><p id=p12014010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Amaziah would not listen.

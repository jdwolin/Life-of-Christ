<h3 id=p11002001_01-1>David&#8217;s Instructions to Solomon</h3><p id=p11002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>When David&#8217;s time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v11002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man, <b class=verse-num id=v11002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn, <b class=verse-num id=v11002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>that the LORD may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, &#8216;If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.&#8217;</p><p id=p11002004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, avenging in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet. <b class=verse-num id=v11002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. <b class=verse-num id=v11002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. <b class=verse-num id=v11002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, &#8216;I will not put you to death with the sword.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p11002009_05-1>The Death of David</h3><p id=p11002009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. <b class=verse-num id=v11002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.</p><h3 id=p11002012_09-1>Solomon&#8217;s Reign Established</h3><p id=p11002012_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, &#8220;Do you come peacefully?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Peacefully.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;I have something to say to you.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother&#8217;s, for it was his from the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v11002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me.&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Please ask King Solomon&#8212;he will not refuse you&#8212;to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Bathsheba said, &#8220;Very well; I will speak for you to the king.&#8221;</p><p id=p11002018_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king&#8217;s mother, and she sat on his right. <b class=verse-num id=v11002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then she said, &#8220;I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me.&#8221; And the king said to her, &#8220;Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>She said, &#8220;Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>King Solomon answered his mother, &#8220;And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, &#8220;God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life! <b class=verse-num id=v11002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.</p><p id=p11002025_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And to Abiathar the priest the king said, &#8220;Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you shared in all my father&#8217;s affliction.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, thus fulfilling the word of the LORD that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p><p id=p11002027_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When the news came to Joab&#8212;for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom&#8212;Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and caught hold of the horns of the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v11002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when it was told King Solomon, &#8220;Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar,&#8221; Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, &#8220;Go, strike him down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, &#8220;The king commands, &#8216;Come out.&#8217;&#8221; But he said, &#8220;No, I will die here.&#8221; Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, &#8220;Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>The king replied to him, &#8220;Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father&#8217;s house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause. <b class=verse-num id=v11002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The LORD will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v11002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the LORD forevermore.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v11002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</p><p id=p11002035_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, &#8220;Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever. <b class=verse-num id=v11002037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. Your blood shall be on your own head.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Shimei said to the king, &#8220;What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.&#8221; So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.</p><p id=p11002038_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11002039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei&#8217;s servants ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimei, &#8220;Behold, your servants are in Gath,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. <b class=verse-num id=v11002041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned, <b class=verse-num id=v11002042-1>42&nbsp;</b>the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, &#8220;Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, &#8216;Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die&#8217;? And you said to me, &#8216;What you say is good; I will obey.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11002043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Why then have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the commandment with which I commanded you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The king also said to Shimei, &#8220;You know in your own heart all the harm that you did to David my father. So the LORD will bring back your harm on your own head. <b class=verse-num id=v11002045-1>45&nbsp;</b>But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11002046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died.</p><p id=p11002046_12-1>So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</p></div>

<h3 id=p11003001_01-1>Solomon&#8217;s Prayer for Wisdom</h3><p id=p11003001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.</p><p id=p11003002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places. <b class=verse-num id=v11003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. <b class=verse-num id=v11003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, &#8220;Ask what I shall give you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Solomon said, &#8220;You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day. <b class=verse-num id=v11003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in. <b class=verse-num id=v11003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v11003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?&#8221;</p><p id=p11003009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. <b class=verse-num id=v11003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God said to him, &#8220;Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, <b class=verse-num id=v11003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. <b class=verse-num id=v11003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. <b class=verse-num id=v11003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.&#8221;</p><p id=p11003014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</p><h3 id=p11003015_05-1>Solomon&#8217;s Wisdom</h3><p id=p11003015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The one woman said, &#8220;Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. <b class=verse-num id=v11003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were alone. There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house. <b class=verse-num id=v11003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And this woman&#8217;s son died in the night, because she lay on him. <b class=verse-num id=v11003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast. <b class=verse-num id=v11003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the child that I had borne.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the other woman said, &#8220;No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours.&#8221; The first said, &#8220;No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine.&#8221; Thus they spoke before the king.</p><p id=p11003022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v11003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the king said, &#8220;The one says, &#8216;This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead&#8217;; and the other says, &#8216;No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Bring me a sword.&#8221; So a sword was brought before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v11003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because her heart yearned for her son, &#8220;Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means put him to death.&#8221; But the other said, &#8220;He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the king answered and said, &#8220;Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means put him to death; she is his mother.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.</p></div>

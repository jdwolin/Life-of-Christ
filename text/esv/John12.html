<h3 id=p43011001_01-1>The Death of Lazarus</h3><p id=p43011001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. <b class=verse-num id=v43011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. <b class=verse-num id=v43011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So the sisters sent to him, saying, &#8220;Lord, he whom you love is ill.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when Jesus heard it he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43011004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <b class=verse-num id=v43011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. <b class=verse-num id=v43011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then after this he said to the disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let us go to Judea again.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>After saying these things, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, &#8220;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. <b class=verse-num id=v43011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus told them plainly, <span class=woc>&#8220;Lazarus has died,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43011016_05-1>I Am the Resurrection and the Life</h3><p id=p43011016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. <b class=verse-num id=v43011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, <b class=verse-num id=v43011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. <b class=verse-num id=v43011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house. <b class=verse-num id=v43011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Martha said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. <b class=verse-num id=v43011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Martha said to him, &#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>She said to him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43011027_12-1>Jesus Weeps</h3><p id=p43011027_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, &#8220;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. <b class=verse-num id=v43011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. <b class=verse-num id=v43011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. <b class=verse-num id=v43011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Where have you laid him?&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;Lord, come and see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Jesus wept. <b class=verse-num id=v43011036-1>36&nbsp;</b>So the Jews said, &#8220;See how he loved him!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But some of them said, &#8220;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43011037_14-1>Jesus Raises Lazarus</h3><p id=p43011037_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <b class=verse-num id=v43011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221;</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &#8220;Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43011042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011043-1>43&nbsp;</b>When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <span class=woc>&#8220;Lazarus, come out.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43011044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Unbind him, and let him go.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43011044_17-1>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h3><p id=p43011044_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him, <b class=verse-num id=v43011046-1>46&nbsp;</b>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <b class=verse-num id=v43011047-1>47&nbsp;</b>So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, &#8220;What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. <b class=verse-num id=v43011048-1>48&nbsp;</b>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011049-1>49&nbsp;</b>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, &#8220;You know nothing at all. <b class=verse-num id=v43011050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011051-1>51&nbsp;</b>He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <b class=verse-num id=v43011052-1>52&nbsp;</b>and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. <b class=verse-num id=v43011053-1>53&nbsp;</b>So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.</p><p id=p43011053_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011054-1>54&nbsp;</b>Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.</p><p id=p43011054_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v43011055-1>55&nbsp;</b>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v43011056-1>56&nbsp;</b>They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, &#8220;What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43011057-1>57&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.</p></div>

<h3 id=p43012001_01-1>Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany</h3><p id=p43012001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v43012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table. <b class=verse-num id=v43012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <b class=verse-num id=v43012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, <b class=verse-num id=v43012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. <b class=verse-num id=v43012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43012008_06-1>The Plot to Kill Lazarus</h3><p id=p43012008_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v43012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v43012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, <b class=verse-num id=v43012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</p><h3 id=p43012011_11-1>The Triumphal Entry</h3><p id=p43012011_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v43012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, &#8220;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p43012015_14-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v43012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Fear not, daughter of Zion;</span><br /><span id=p43012015_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, your king is coming,</span><br /><span id=p43012015_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting on a donkey&#8217;s colt!&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p43012015_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v43012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. <b class=verse-num id=v43012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. <b class=verse-num id=v43012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So the Pharisees said to one another, &#8220;You see that you are gaining nothing.

<h3 id=p43013001_01-1>Jesus Washes the Disciples&#8217; Feet</h3><p id=p43013001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. <b class=verse-num id=v43013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s son, to betray him, <b class=verse-num id=v43013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, <b class=verse-num id=v43013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. <b class=verse-num id=v43013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <b class=verse-num id=v43013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &#8220;Lord, do you wash my feet?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Peter said to him, &#8220;You shall never wash my feet.&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Not all of you are clean.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43013011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you understand what I have done to you?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, &#8216;He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43013020_06-1>One of You Will Betray Me</h3><p id=p43013020_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. <b class=verse-num id=v43013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus&#8217; side, <b class=verse-num id=v43013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. <b class=verse-num id=v43013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, &#8220;Lord, who is it?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.&#8221;</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <b class=verse-num id=v43013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What you are going to do, do quickly.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#8220;Buy what we need for the feast,&#8221; or that he should give something to the poor. <b class=verse-num id=v43013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p><h3 id=p43013030_12-1>A New Commandment</h3><p id=p43013030_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, &#8216;Where I am going you cannot come.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43013035_15-1>Jesus Foretells Peter&#8217;s Denial</h3><p id=p43013035_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, where are you going?&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</span></p></div>

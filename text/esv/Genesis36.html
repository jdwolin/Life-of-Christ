<h3 id=p01035001_01-1>God Blesses and Renames Jacob</h3><p id=p01035001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01035001-1>35:1&nbsp;</b>God said to Jacob, &#8220;Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &#8220;Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. <b class=verse-num id=v01035003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.</p><p id=p01035004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. <b class=verse-num id=v01035006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, <b class=verse-num id=v01035007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01035008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Deborah, Rebekah&#8217;s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.</p><p id=p01035008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035009-1>9&nbsp;</b>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01035010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And God said to him, &#8220;Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.&#8221; So he called his name Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v01035011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God said to him, &#8220;I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. <b class=verse-num id=v01035012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01035014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. <b class=verse-num id=v01035015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.</p><h3 id=p01035015_06-1>The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac</h3><p id=p01035015_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor. <b class=verse-num id=v01035017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, &#8220;Do not fear, for you have another son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin. <b class=verse-num id=v01035019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem), <b class=verse-num id=v01035020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel&#8217;s tomb, which is there to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v01035021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</p><p id=p01035021_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035022-1>22&nbsp;</b>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&#8217;s concubine. And Israel heard of it.</p><p id=p01035022_12-1>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. <b class=verse-num id=v01035023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob&#8217;s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. <b class=verse-num id=v01035024-1>24&nbsp;</b>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. <b class=verse-num id=v01035025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel&#8217;s servant: Dan and Naphtali. <b class=verse-num id=v01035026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The sons of Zilpah, Leah&#8217;s servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.</p><p id=p01035026_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. <b class=verse-num id=v01035028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. <b class=verse-num id=v01035029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p></div>

He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father&#8217;s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. <b class=verse-num id=v01037003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors. <b class=verse-num id=v01037004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.</p><p id=p01037004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. <b class=verse-num id=v01037006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Hear this dream that I have dreamed: <b class=verse-num id=v01037007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037008-1>8&nbsp;</b>His brothers said to him, &#8220;Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?&#8221; So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</p><p id=p01037008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, &#8220;Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, &#8220;What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</p><h3 id=p01037011_03-1>Joseph Sold by His Brothers</h3><p id=p01037011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now his brothers went to pasture their father&#8217;s flock near Shechem. <b class=verse-num id=v01037013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he said to him, &#8220;Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word.&#8221; So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <b class=verse-num id=v01037015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, &#8220;What are you seeking?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I am seeking my brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the man said, &#8220;They have gone away, for I heard them say, &#8216;Let us go to Dothan.&#8217;&#8221; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.</p><p id=p01037017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. <b class=verse-num id=v01037019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They said to one another, &#8220;Here comes this dreamer. <b class=verse-num id=v01037020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits.

The pit was empty; there was no water in it.</p><p id=p01037024_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01037026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to his brothers, &#8220;What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? <b class=verse-num id=v01037027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.&#8221; And his brothers listened to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01037028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.</p><p id=p01037028_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01037029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes <b class=verse-num id=v01037030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and returned to his brothers and said, &#8220;The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then they took Joseph&#8217;s robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. <b class=verse-num id=v01037032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, &#8220;This we have found; please identify whether it is your son&#8217;s robe or not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he identified it and said, &#8220;It is my son&#8217;s robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01037034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. <b class=verse-num id=v01037035-1>35&nbsp;</b>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, &#8220;No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.&#8221; Thus his father wept for him. <b class=verse-num id=v01037036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</p></div>

And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God, as his father David had done, <b class=verse-num id=v12016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even burned his son as an offering, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.</p><p id=p12016004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him. <b class=verse-num id=v12016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>At that time Rezin the king of Syria recovered Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah from Elath, and the Edomites came to Elath, where they dwell to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v12016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, &#8220;I am your servant and your son.

And Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. <b class=verse-num id=v12017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison. <b class=verse-num id=v12017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria, and for three years he besieged it.</p><h3 id=p12017005_05-1>The Fall of Israel</h3><p id=p12017005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p><h3 id=p12017006_09-1>Exile Because of Idolatry</h3><p id=p12017006_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And this occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods <b class=verse-num id=v12017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had practiced. <b class=verse-num id=v12017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did secretly against the LORD their God things that were not right. They built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city. <b class=verse-num id=v12017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, <b class=verse-num id=v12017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. And they did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger, <b class=verse-num id=v12017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, &#8220;You shall not do this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, &#8220;Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the Law that I commanded your fathers, and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.&#8221;</p><p id=p12017013_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in the LORD their God. <b class=verse-num id=v12017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They despised his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and the warnings that he gave them. They went after false idols and became false, and they followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should not do like them. <b class=verse-num id=v12017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves metal images of two calves; and they made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal. <b class=verse-num id=v12017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings and used divination and omens and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v12017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. None was left but the tribe of Judah only.</p><p id=p12017018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. <b class=verse-num id=v12017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</p><p id=p12017020_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When he had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king.

And they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. <b class=verse-num id=v12017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD. Therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them. <b class=verse-num id=v12017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So the king of Assyria was told, &#8220;The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land.

They do not fear the LORD, and they do not follow the statutes or the rules or the law or the commandment that the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12017035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The LORD made a covenant with them and commanded them, &#8220;You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them, <b class=verse-num id=v12017036-1>36&nbsp;</b>but you shall fear the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm. You shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v12017037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And the statutes and the rules and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods, <b class=verse-num id=v12017038-1>38&nbsp;</b>and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods, <b class=verse-num id=v12017039-1>39&nbsp;</b>but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017040-1>40&nbsp;</b>However, they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.</p><p id=p12017040_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So these nations feared the LORD and also served their carved images.

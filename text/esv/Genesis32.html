<h3 id=p01031001_01-1>Jacob Flees from Laban</h3><p id=p01031001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01031001-1>31:1&nbsp;</b>Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, &#8220;Jacob has taken all that was our father&#8217;s, and from what was our father&#8217;s he has gained all this wealth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before. <b class=verse-num id=v01031003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Jacob, &#8220;Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was <b class=verse-num id=v01031005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031006-1>6&nbsp;</b>You know that I have served your father with all my strength, <b class=verse-num id=v01031007-1>7&nbsp;</b>yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If he said, &#8216;The spotted shall be your wages,&#8217; then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, &#8216;The striped shall be your wages,&#8217; then all the flock bore striped. <b class=verse-num id=v01031009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled. <b class=verse-num id=v01031011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, &#8216;Jacob,&#8217; and I said, &#8216;Here I am!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01031012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8216;Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. <b class=verse-num id=v01031013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, &#8220;Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father&#8217;s house? <b class=verse-num id=v01031015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <b class=verse-num id=v01031016-1>16&nbsp;</b>All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <b class=verse-num id=v01031018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v01031019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father&#8217;s household gods. <b class=verse-num id=v01031020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee. <b class=verse-num id=v01031021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</p><p id=p01031021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <b class=verse-num id=v01031023-1>23&nbsp;</b>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v01031024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v01031026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword? <b class=verse-num id=v01031027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre? <b class=verse-num id=v01031028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly. <b class=verse-num id=v01031029-1>29&nbsp;</b>It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, &#8216;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01031030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father&#8217;s house, but why did you steal my gods?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Jacob answered and said to Laban, &#8220;Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. <b class=verse-num id=v01031032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.&#8221; Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</p><p id=p01031032_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So Laban went into Jacob&#8217;s tent and into Leah&#8217;s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah&#8217;s tent and entered Rachel&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v01031034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel&#8217;s saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them. <b class=verse-num id=v01031035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And she said to her father, &#8220;Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.&#8221; So he searched but did not find the household gods.</p><p id=p01031035_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? <b class=verse-num id=v01031037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two. <b class=verse-num id=v01031038-1>38&nbsp;</b>These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks. <b class=verse-num id=v01031039-1>39&nbsp;</b>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <b class=verse-num id=v01031040-1>40&nbsp;</b>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v01031041-1>41&nbsp;</b>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. <b class=verse-num id=v01031042-1>42&nbsp;</b>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031042_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, &#8220;The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne? <b class=verse-num id=v01031044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01031045-1>45&nbsp;</b>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. <b class=verse-num id=v01031046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, &#8220;Gather stones.&#8221; And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. <b class=verse-num id=v01031047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. <b class=verse-num id=v01031048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Laban said, &#8220;This heap is a witness between you and me today.&#8221; Therefore he named it Galeed, <b class=verse-num id=v01031049-1>49&nbsp;</b>and Mizpah, for he said, &#8220;The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another&#8217;s sight. <b class=verse-num id=v01031050-1>50&nbsp;</b>If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01031050_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Then Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me. <b class=verse-num id=v01031052-1>52&nbsp;</b>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. <b class=verse-num id=v01031053-1>53&nbsp;</b>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.&#8221; So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, <b class=verse-num id=v01031054-1>54&nbsp;</b>and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.</p><p id=p01031054_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01031055-1>55&nbsp;</b>Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01032001_01-1>Jacob Fears Esau</h3><p id=p01032001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01032001-1>32:1&nbsp;</b>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when Jacob saw them he said, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s camp!&#8221; So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p><p id=p01032002_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, <b class=verse-num id=v01032004-1>4&nbsp;</b>instructing them, &#8220;Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, &#8216;I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now. <b class=verse-num id=v01032005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01032005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &#8220;We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, <b class=verse-num id=v01032008-1>8&nbsp;</b>thinking, &#8220;If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.&#8221;</p><p id=p01032008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said, &#8220;O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, &#8216;Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01032010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps. <b class=verse-num id=v01032011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children. <b class=verse-num id=v01032012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But you said, &#8216;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01032012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau, <b class=verse-num id=v01032014-1>14&nbsp;</b>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <b class=verse-num id=v01032015-1>15&nbsp;</b>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v01032016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, &#8220;Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He instructed the first, &#8220;When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, &#8216;To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>then you shall say, &#8216;They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, &#8220;You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him, <b class=verse-num id=v01032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and you shall say, &#8216;Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; For he thought, &#8220;I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p><h3 id=p01032021_04-1>Jacob Wrestles with God</h3><p id=p01032021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. <b class=verse-num id=v01032023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had. <b class=verse-num id=v01032024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. <b class=verse-num id=v01032025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob&#8217;s hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Let me go, for the day has broken.&#8221; But Jacob said, &#8220;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Jacob.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob asked him, &#8220;Please tell me your name.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;Why is it that you ask my name?&#8221; And there he blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip. <b class=verse-num id=v01032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip on the sinew of the thigh.</p></div>

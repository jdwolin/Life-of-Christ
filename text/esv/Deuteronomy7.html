How can I dispossess them?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v05007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out.

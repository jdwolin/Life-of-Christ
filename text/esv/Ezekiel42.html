<h3 id=p26041001_01-1>The Inner Temple</h3><p id=p26041001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26041001-1>41:1&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the nave and measured the jambs. On each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs. <b class=verse-num id=v26041002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26041003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side of the entrance, seven cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26041004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across the nave. And he said to me, &#8220;This is the Most Holy Place.&#8221;</p><p id=p26041004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v26041006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v26041007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story. <b class=verse-num id=v26041008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26041009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The free space between the side chambers of the temple and the <b class=verse-num id=v26041010-1>10&nbsp;</b>other chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side. <b class=verse-num id=v26041011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the doors of the side chambers opened on the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.</p><p id=p26041011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The building that was facing the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</p><p id=p26041012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long; <b class=verse-num id=v26041014-1>14&nbsp;</b>also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.</p><p id=p26041014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard that was at the back and its galleries on either side, a hundred cubits.</p><p id=p26041015_04-1>The inside of the nave and the vestibules of the court, <b class=verse-num id=v26041016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the thresholds and the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered), <b class=verse-num id=v26041017-1>17&nbsp;</b>to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern. <b class=verse-num id=v26041018-1>18&nbsp;</b>It was carved of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces: <b class=verse-num id=v26041019-1>19&nbsp;</b>a human face toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26041020-1>20&nbsp;</b>From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; similarly the wall of the nave.</p><p id=p26041020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26041021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The doorposts of the nave were squared, and in front of the Holy Place was something resembling <b class=verse-num id=v26041022-1>22&nbsp;</b>an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, &#8220;This is the table that is before the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26041023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The nave and the Holy Place had each a double door. <b class=verse-num id=v26041024-1>24&nbsp;</b>The double doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door. <b class=verse-num id=v26041025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls. And there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside. <b class=verse-num id=v26041026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, the side chambers of the temple, and the canopies.</p></div>

<h3 id=p26042001_01-1>The Temple&#8217;s Chambers</h3><p id=p26042001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26042001-1>42:1&nbsp;</b>Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers that were opposite the separate yard and opposite the building on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v26042002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The length of the building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26042003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Facing the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. <b class=verse-num id=v26042004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, and their doors were on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v26042005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building. <b class=verse-num id=v26042006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones. <b class=verse-num id=v26042007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long. <b class=verse-num id=v26042008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the nave were a hundred cubits long. <b class=verse-num id=v26042009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.</p><p id=p26042009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26042010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers <b class=verse-num id=v26042011-1>11&nbsp;</b>with a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors, <b class=verse-num id=v26042012-1>12&nbsp;</b>as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.</p><p id=p26042012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26042013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings&#8212;the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering&#8212;for the place is holy. <b class=verse-num id=v26042014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.&#8221;</p><p id=p26042014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26042015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26042016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26042017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26042018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26042019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26042020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 cubits long and 500 cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.</p></div>

And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory. <b class=verse-num id=v26043003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal. And I fell on my face. <b class=verse-num id=v26043004-1>4&nbsp;</b>As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east, <b class=verse-num id=v26043005-1>5&nbsp;</b>the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple.</p><p id=p26043005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26043006-1>6&nbsp;</b>While the man was standing beside me, I heard one speaking to me out of the temple, <b class=verse-num id=v26043007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places, <b class=verse-num id=v26043008-1>8&nbsp;</b>by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them.

And this shall be the height of the altar: <b class=verse-num id=v26043014-1>14&nbsp;</b>from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; <b class=verse-num id=v26043015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns. <b class=verse-num id=v26043016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad. <b class=verse-num id=v26043017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit all around.

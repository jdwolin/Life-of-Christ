Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity. <b class=verse-num id=v26036018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it. <b class=verse-num id=v26036019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them. <b class=verse-num id=v26036020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, &#8216;These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26036021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.</p><h3 id=p26036021_14-1>I Will Put My Spirit Within You</h3><p id=p26036021_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v26036022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. <b class=verse-num id=v26036023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v26036024-1>24&nbsp;</b>I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. <b class=verse-num id=v26036025-1>25&nbsp;</b>I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. <b class=verse-num id=v26036026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you.

Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</p><p id=p26036032_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v26036033-1>33&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt. <b class=verse-num id=v26036034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by. <b class=verse-num id=v26036035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And they will say, &#8216;This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26036036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate.

Then they will know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

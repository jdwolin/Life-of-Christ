And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, &#8216;They will respect my son.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But those tenants said to one another, &#8216;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Have you not read this Scripture:</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p41012010_06-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;The stone that the builders rejected</span><br /><span id=p41012010_06-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become the cornerstone;</span></span><br /><span id=p41012011_06-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline woc id=v41012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>this was the Lord&#8217;s doing,</span><br /><span id=p41012011_06-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it is marvelous in our eyes&#8217;?&#8221;</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></span></p><p id=p41012011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v41012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they left him and went away.</p><h3 id=p41012012_06-1>Paying Taxes to Caesar</h3><p id=p41012012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v41012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. <b class=verse-num id=v41012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they came and said to him, &#8220;Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone&#8217;s opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they brought one.

And they asked him a question, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v41012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&#8217;s brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v41012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring. <b class=verse-num id=v41012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. <b class=verse-num id=v41012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died. <b class=verse-num id=v41012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.&#8221;</p><p id=p41012023_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v41012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, &#8216;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#8217;?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He is not God of the dead, but of the living.

You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. <b class=verse-num id=v41012033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one&#8217;s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41012034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span> And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p><h3 id=p41012034_19-1>Whose Son Is the Christ?</h3><p id=p41012034_24-1><b class=verse-num id=v41012035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared,</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p41012036_24-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</span><br /><span id=p41012036_24-1 class=line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sit at my right hand,</span><br /><span id=p41012036_24-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I put your enemies under your feet.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></span></p><p id=p41012036_24-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num woc id=v41012037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>David himself calls him Lord.

Many rich people put in large sums. <b class=verse-num id=v41012042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. <b class=verse-num id=v41012043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he called his disciples to him and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.&#8221;</span></p></div>

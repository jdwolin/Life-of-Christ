<h3 id=p47005001_01-1>Our Heavenly Dwelling</h3><p id=p47005001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. <b class=verse-num id=v47005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, <b class=verse-num id=v47005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. <b class=verse-num id=v47005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened&#8212;not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. <b class=verse-num id=v47005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</p><p id=p47005005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v47005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, <b class=verse-num id=v47005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>for we walk by faith, not by sight. <b class=verse-num id=v47005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v47005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. <b class=verse-num id=v47005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.</p><h3 id=p47005010_04-1>The Ministry of Reconciliation</h3><p id=p47005010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v47005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v47005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. <b class=verse-num id=v47005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. <b class=verse-num id=v47005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; <b class=verse-num id=v47005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</p><p id=p47005015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v47005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. <b class=verse-num id=v47005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. <b class=verse-num id=v47005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; <b class=verse-num id=v47005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. <b class=verse-num id=v47005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. <b class=verse-num id=v47005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p></div>

<p id=p47007001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.</p><h3 id=p47007001_01-1>Paul&#8217;s Joy</h3><p id=p47007001_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v47007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Make room in your hearts for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. <b class=verse-num id=v47007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. <b class=verse-num id=v47007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.</p><p id=p47007004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v47007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turn&#8212;fighting without and fear within. <b class=verse-num id=v47007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, <b class=verse-num id=v47007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more. <b class=verse-num id=v47007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it&#8212;though I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while. <b class=verse-num id=v47007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.</p><p id=p47007009_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v47007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. <b class=verse-num id=v47007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v47007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God. <b class=verse-num id=v47007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore we are comforted.</p><p id=p47007013_03-1>And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. <b class=verse-num id=v47007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For whatever boasts I made to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proved true. <b class=verse-num id=v47007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling. <b class=verse-num id=v47007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I rejoice, because I have complete confidence in you.</p></div>

<p id=p43008001_01-1 class=virtual><b class=chapter-num id=v43008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <b class=verse-num id=v43008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. <b class=verse-num id=v43008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst <b class=verse-num id=v43008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>they said to him, &#8220;Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. <b class=verse-num id=v43008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v43008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v43008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. <b class=verse-num id=v43008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus stood up and said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>She said, &#8220;No one, Lord.&#8221; And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43008011_01-1>I Am the Light of the World</h3><p id=p43008011_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=verse-num id=v43008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So the Pharisees said to him, &#8220;You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They said to him therefore, &#8220;Where is your Father?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</p><p id=p43008020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So he said to them again, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the Jews said, &#8220;Will he kill himself, since he says, <span class=woc>&#8216;Where I am going, you cannot come&#8217;</span>?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So they said to him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father. <b class=verse-num id=v43008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>As he was saying these things, many believed in him.</p><h3 id=p43008030_08-1>The Truth Will Set You Free</h3><p id=p43008030_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, &#8216;You will become free&#8217;?&#8221;</p><p id=p43008033_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43008038_14-1>You Are of Your Father the Devil</h3><p id=p43008038_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008039-1>39&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;Abraham is our father.&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;If you were Abraham&#8217;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You are doing the works your father did.&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father&#8212;even God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&#8217;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008045-1>45&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008046-1>46&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43008047_21-1>Before Abraham Was, I Am</h3><p id=p43008047_26-1><b class=verse-num id=v43008048-1>48&nbsp;</b>The Jews answered him, &#8220;Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008050-1>50&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008051-1>51&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The Jews said to him, &#8220;Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, <span class=woc>&#8216;If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008053-1>53&nbsp;</b>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008054-1>54&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, &#8216;He is our God.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008055-1>55&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43008056-1>56&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008057-1>57&nbsp;</b>So the Jews said to him, &#8220;You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43008058-1>58&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43008059-1>59&nbsp;</b>So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</p></div>

Then he anointed the man&#8217;s eyes with the mud <b class=verse-num id=v43009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&#8221;</span> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.</p><p id=p43009007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, &#8220;Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Some said, &#8220;It is he.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;No, but he is like him.&#8221; He kept saying, &#8220;I am the man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they said to him, &#8220;Then how were your eyes opened?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Go to Siloam and wash.&#8217;</span> So I went and washed and received my sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p><p id=p43009012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. <b class=verse-num id=v43009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v43009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, &#8220;He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Some of the Pharisees said, &#8220;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221; But others said, &#8220;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#8221; And there was a division among them. <b class=verse-num id=v43009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So they said again to the blind man, &#8220;What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He is a prophet.&#8221;</p><p id=p43009017_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight <b class=verse-num id=v43009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and asked them, &#8220;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>His parents answered, &#8220;We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. <b class=verse-num id=v43009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) <b class=verse-num id=v43009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Therefore his parents said, &#8220;He is of age; ask him.&#8221;</p><p id=p43009023_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, &#8220;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He answered them, &#8220;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they reviled him, saying, &#8220;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v43009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The man answered, &#8220;Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v43009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. <b class=verse-num id=v43009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?&#8221; And they cast him out.</p><p id=p43009034_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Lord, I believe,&#8221; and he worshiped him. <b class=verse-num id=v43009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, &#8220;Are we also blind?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, &#8216;We see,&#8217; your guilt remains.</span></p></div>

If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43010018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43010018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. <b class=verse-num id=v43010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Many of them said, &#8220;He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Others said, &#8220;These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon.

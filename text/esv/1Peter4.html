<h3 id=p60003001_01-1>Wives and Husbands</h3><p id=p60003001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v60003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, <b class=verse-num id=v60003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>when they see your respectful and pure conduct. <b class=verse-num id=v60003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do not let your adorning be external&#8212;the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v60003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God&#8217;s sight is very precious. <b class=verse-num id=v60003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands, <b class=verse-num id=v60003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.</p><p id=p60003006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v60003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.</p><h3 id=p60003007_04-1>Suffering for Righteousness&#8217; Sake</h3><p id=p60003007_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v60003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. <b class=verse-num id=v60003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. <b class=verse-num id=v60003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p60003010_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Whoever desires to love life</span><br /><span id=p60003010_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see good days,</span><br /><span id=p60003010_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;let him keep his tongue from evil</span><br /><span id=p60003010_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his lips from speaking deceit;</span><br /><span id=p60003011_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v60003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;let him turn away from evil and do good;</span><br /><span id=p60003011_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him seek peace and pursue it.</span><br /><span id=p60003012_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v60003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,</span><br /><span id=p60003012_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his ears are open to their prayer.</span><br /><span id=p60003012_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p60003012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v60003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? <b class=verse-num id=v60003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But even if you should suffer for righteousness&#8217; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, <b class=verse-num id=v60003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, <b class=verse-num id=v60003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. <b class=verse-num id=v60003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God&#8217;s will, than for doing evil.</p><p id=p60003017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v60003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, <b class=verse-num id=v60003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, <b class=verse-num id=v60003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>because they formerly did not obey, when God&#8217;s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. <b class=verse-num id=v60003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v60003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.</p></div>

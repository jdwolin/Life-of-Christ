But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. <b class=verse-num id=v07009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And all the leaders of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.</p><p id=p07009006_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them, &#8220;Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you. <b class=verse-num id=v07009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The trees once went out to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, &#8216;Reign over us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But the olive tree said to them, &#8216;Shall I leave my abundance, by which gods and men are honored, and go hold sway over the trees?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the trees said to the fig tree, &#8216;You come and reign over us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But the fig tree said to them, &#8216;Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the trees said to the vine, &#8216;You come and reign over us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But the vine said to them, &#8216;Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then all the trees said to the bramble, &#8216;You come and reign over us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the bramble said to the trees, &#8216;If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.&#8217;</p><p id=p07009015_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his deeds deserved&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v07009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian, <b class=verse-num id=v07009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and you have risen up against my father&#8217;s house this day and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v07009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. <b class=verse-num id=v07009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and lived there, because of Abimelech his brother.</p><h3 id=p07009021_03-1>The Downfall of Abimelech</h3><p id=p07009021_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. <b class=verse-num id=v07009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, <b class=verse-num id=v07009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v07009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way. And it was told to Abimelech.</p><p id=p07009025_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives, and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him. <b class=verse-num id=v07009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech. <b class=verse-num id=v07009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, &#8220;Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? <b class=verse-num id=v07009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. I would say to Abimelech, &#8216;Increase your army, and come out.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p07009029_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. <b class=verse-num id=v07009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, &#8220;Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you. <b class=verse-num id=v07009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, go by night, you and the people who are with you, and set an ambush in the field. <b class=verse-num id=v07009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city. And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as your hand finds to do.&#8221;</p><p id=p07009033_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies. <b class=verse-num id=v07009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush. <b class=verse-num id=v07009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, &#8220;Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!&#8221; And Zebul said to him, &#8220;You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Gaal spoke again and said, &#8220;Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners&#8217; Oak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Zebul said to him, &#8220;Where is your mouth now, you who said, &#8216;Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?&#8217; Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. <b class=verse-num id=v07009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v07009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem.</p><p id=p07009041_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009042-1>42&nbsp;</b>On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told. <b class=verse-num id=v07009043-1>43&nbsp;</b>He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them. <b class=verse-num id=v07009044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them. <b class=verse-num id=v07009045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and he razed the city and sowed it with salt.</p><p id=p07009045_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009046-1>46&nbsp;</b>When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith. <b class=verse-num id=v07009047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together. <b class=verse-num id=v07009048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, &#8220;What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07009049-1>49&nbsp;</b>So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.</p><p id=p07009049_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07009050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it. <b class=verse-num id=v07009051-1>51&nbsp;</b>But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower. <b class=verse-num id=v07009052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v07009053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech&#8217;s head and crushed his skull. <b class=verse-num id=v07009054-1>54&nbsp;</b>Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, &#8220;Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, &#8216;A woman killed him.&#8217;&#8221; And his young man thrust him through, and he died. <b class=verse-num id=v07009055-1>55&nbsp;</b>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone departed to his home. <b class=verse-num id=v07009056-1>56&nbsp;</b>Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v07009057-1>57&nbsp;</b>And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</p></div>

And they forsook the LORD and did not serve him. <b class=verse-num id=v07010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites, <b class=verse-num id=v07010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year.

The LORD, the Judge, decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent to him.</p><h3 id=p07011028_04-1>Jephthah&#8217;s Tragic Vow</h3><p id=p07011028_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then the Spirit of the LORD was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v07011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, &#8220;If you will give the Ammonites into my hand, <b class=verse-num id=v07011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>then whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites shall be the LORD&#8217;s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD gave them into his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v07011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he struck them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a great blow. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.</p><p id=p07011033_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v07011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah. And behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter. <b class=verse-num id=v07011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And as soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, &#8220;Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot take back my vow.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07011036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And she said to him, &#8220;My father, you have opened your mouth to the LORD; do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the LORD has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07011037-1>37&nbsp;</b>So she said to her father, &#8220;Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my companions.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07011038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So he said, &#8220;Go.&#8221; Then he sent her away for two months, and she departed, she and her companions, and wept for her virginity on the mountains. <b class=verse-num id=v07011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow that he had made. She had never known a man, and it became a custom in Israel <b class=verse-num id=v07011040-1>40&nbsp;</b>that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44007001_01-1>Stephen&#8217;s Speech</h3><p id=p44007001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>And the high priest said, &#8220;Are these things so?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Stephen said:</p><p id=p44007002_03-1>&#8220;Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, <b class=verse-num id=v44007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8216;Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. <b class=verse-num id=v44007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot&#8217;s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. <b class=verse-num id=v44007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And God spoke to this effect&#8212;that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. <b class=verse-num id=v44007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8216;But I will judge the nation that they serve,&#8217; said God, &#8216;and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</p><p id=p44007008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him <b class=verse-num id=v44007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. <b class=verse-num id=v44007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. <b class=verse-num id=v44007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit. <b class=verse-num id=v44007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph&#8217;s family became known to Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v44007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. <b class=verse-num id=v44007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v44007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</p><p id=p44007016_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt <b class=verse-num id=v44007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v44007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God&#8217;s sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father&#8217;s house, <b class=verse-num id=v44007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and when he was exposed, Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. <b class=verse-num id=v44007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</p><p id=p44007022_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v44007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. <b class=verse-num id=v44007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand. <b class=verse-num id=v44007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, &#8216;Men, you are brothers.

And now come, I will send you to Egypt.&#8217;</p><p id=p44007034_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&#8220;This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, &#8216;Who made you a ruler and a judge?&#8217;&#8212;this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <b class=verse-num id=v44007036-1>36&nbsp;</b>This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v44007037-1>37&nbsp;</b>This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, &#8216;God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007038-1>38&nbsp;</b>This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us. <b class=verse-num id=v44007039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v44007040-1>40&nbsp;</b>saying to Aaron, &#8216;Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v44007042-1>42&nbsp;</b>But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44007042_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices,</span><br /><span id=p44007042_03-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44007043-1>43&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You took up the tent of Moloch</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the star of your god Rephan,</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the images that you made to worship;</span><br /><span id=p44007043_03-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44007043_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007044-1>44&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen. <b class=verse-num id=v44007045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers.

<h3 id=p24038001_01-1>Jeremiah Cast into the Cistern</h3><p id=p24038001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v24038001-1>38:1&nbsp;</b>Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people: <b class=verse-num id=v24038002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live. <b class=verse-num id=v24038003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the officials said to the king, &#8220;Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038005-1>5&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah said, &#8220;Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king&#8217;s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.</p><h3 id=p24038006_06-1>Jeremiah Rescued from the Cistern</h3><p id=p24038006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king&#8217;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern&#8212;the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v24038008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Ebed-melech went from the king&#8217;s house and said to the king, <b class=verse-num id=v24038009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, &#8220;Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes. <b class=verse-num id=v24038012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, &#8220;Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.&#8221; Jeremiah did so. <b class=verse-num id=v24038013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p><h3 id=p24038013_11-1>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again</h3><p id=p24038013_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038014-1>14&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, &#8220;I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &#8220;If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, &#8220;As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life.&#8221;</p><p id=p24038016_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. <b class=verse-num id=v24038018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038019-1>19&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &#8220;I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Jeremiah said, &#8220;You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared. <b class=verse-num id=v24038021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me: <b class=verse-num id=v24038022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p24038022_15-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Your trusted friends have deceived you</span><br /><span id=p24038022_15-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prevailed against you;</span><br /><span id=p24038022_15-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;now that your feet are sunk in the mud,</span><br /><span id=p24038022_15-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they turn away from you.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p24038022_15-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v24038023-1>23&nbsp;</b>All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.&#8221;</p><p id=p24038023_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v24038024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &#8220;Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. <b class=verse-num id=v24038025-1>25&nbsp;</b>If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, &#8216;Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v24038026-1>26&nbsp;</b>then you shall say to them, &#8216;I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard. <b class=verse-num id=v24038028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</p></div>

And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him. <b class=verse-num id=v24039006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v24039007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v24039008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The Chaldeans burned the king&#8217;s house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v24039009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained. <b class=verse-num id=v24039010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p><h3 id=p24039010_05-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Delivers Jeremiah</h3><p id=p24039010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v24039011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v24039012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24039013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon <b class=verse-num id=v24039014-1>14&nbsp;</b>sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard.

<h3 id=p24040001_01-1>Jeremiah Remains in Judah</h3><p id=p24040001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v24040001-1>40:1&nbsp;</b>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v24040002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, &#8220;The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place. <b class=verse-num id=v24040003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you. <b class=verse-num id=v24040004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. <b class=verse-num id=v24040005-1>5&nbsp;</b>If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.&#8221; So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. <b class=verse-num id=v24040006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.</p><p id=p24040006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24040007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon, <b class=verse-num id=v24040008-1>8&nbsp;</b>they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah&#8212;Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. <b class=verse-num id=v24040009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, &#8220;Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. <b class=verse-num id=v24040010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24040011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them, <b class=verse-num id=v24040012-1>12&nbsp;</b>then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.</p><p id=p24040012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24040013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah <b class=verse-num id=v24040014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?&#8221; But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them. <b class=verse-num id=v24040015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, &#8220;Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24040016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, &#8220;You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.&#8221;</p></div>

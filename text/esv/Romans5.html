<h3 id=p45004001_01-1>Abraham Justified by Faith</h3><p id=p45004001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? <b class=verse-num id=v45004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. <b class=verse-num id=v45004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For what does the Scripture say? &#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. <b class=verse-num id=v45004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, <b class=verse-num id=v45004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45004007_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</span><br /><span id=p45004007_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose sins are covered;</span><br /><span id=p45004008_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45004008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v45004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, <b class=verse-num id=v45004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</p><h3 id=p45004012_05-1>The Promise Realized Through Faith</h3><p id=p45004012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. <b class=verse-num id=v45004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. <b class=verse-num id=v45004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</p><p id=p45004015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring&#8212;not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, <b class=verse-num id=v45004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>as it is written, &#8220;I have made you the father of many nations&#8221;&#8212;in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. <b class=verse-num id=v45004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, &#8220;So shall your offspring be.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah&#8217;s womb. <b class=verse-num id=v45004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, <b class=verse-num id=v45004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. <b class=verse-num id=v45004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>That is why his faith was &#8220;counted to him as righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the words &#8220;it was counted to him&#8221; were not written for his sake alone, <b class=verse-num id=v45004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, <b class=verse-num id=v45004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45005001_01-1>Peace with God Through Faith</h3><p id=p45005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v45005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, <b class=verse-num id=v45005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, <b class=verse-num id=v45005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and hope does not put us to shame, because God&#8217;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</p><p id=p45005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. <b class=verse-num id=v45005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For one will scarcely die for a righteous person&#8212;though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. <b class=verse-num id=v45005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. <b class=verse-num id=v45005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</p><h3 id=p45005011_06-1>Death in Adam, Life in Christ</h3><p id=p45005011_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. <b class=verse-num id=v45005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</p><p id=p45005014_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man&#8217;s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. <b class=verse-num id=v45005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the free gift is not like the result of that one man&#8217;s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. <b class=verse-num id=v45005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For if, because of one man&#8217;s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</p><p id=p45005017_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. <b class=verse-num id=v45005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For as by the one man&#8217;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&#8217;s obedience the many will be made righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v45005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, <b class=verse-num id=v45005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p></div>

Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? <b class=verse-num id=v45006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? <b class=verse-num id=v45006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <b class=verse-num id=v45006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p><p id=p45006004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. <b class=verse-num id=v45006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For one who has died has been set free from sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. <b class=verse-num id=v45006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. <b class=verse-num id=v45006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. <b class=verse-num id=v45006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p><p id=p45006011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. <b class=verse-num id=v45006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</p><h3 id=p45006014_07-1>Slaves to Righteousness</h3><p id=p45006014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! <b class=verse-num id=v45006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? <b class=verse-num id=v45006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, <b class=verse-num id=v45006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</p><p id=p45006019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. <b class=verse-num id=v45006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. <b class=verse-num id=v45006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></div>

<h3 id=p11006001_01-1>Solomon Builds the Temple</h3><p id=p11006001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon&#8217;s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v11006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. <b class=verse-num id=v11006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house. <b class=verse-num id=v11006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he made for the house windows with recessed frames. <b class=verse-num id=v11006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary. And he made side chambers all around. <b class=verse-num id=v11006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.</p><p id=p11006006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.</p><p id=p11006007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third. <b class=verse-num id=v11006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar. <b class=verse-num id=v11006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.</p><p id=p11006010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon, <b class=verse-num id=v11006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. <b class=verse-num id=v11006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p11006013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Solomon built the house and finished it. <b class=verse-num id=v11006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. <b class=verse-num id=v11006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place. <b class=verse-num id=v11006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. <b class=verse-num id=v11006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen. <b class=verse-num id=v11006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v11006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid an altar of cedar. <b class=verse-num id=v11006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. <b class=verse-num id=v11006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.</p><p id=p11006022_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high. <b class=verse-num id=v11006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. <b class=verse-num id=v11006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form. <b class=verse-num id=v11006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub. <b class=verse-num id=v11006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house. <b class=verse-num id=v11006028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</p><p id=p11006028_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms. <b class=verse-num id=v11006030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.</p><p id=p11006030_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006031-1>31&nbsp;</b>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. <b class=verse-num id=v11006032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.</p><p id=p11006032_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square, <b class=verse-num id=v11006034-1>34&nbsp;</b>and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. <b class=verse-num id=v11006035-1>35&nbsp;</b>On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. <b class=verse-num id=v11006036-1>36&nbsp;</b>He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.</p><p id=p11006036_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11006037-1>37&nbsp;</b>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv. <b class=verse-num id=v11006038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.</p></div>

<h3 id=p11007001_01-1>Solomon Builds His Palace</h3><p id=p11007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.</p><p id=p11007001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars. <b class=verse-num id=v11007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. <b class=verse-num id=v11007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers. <b class=verse-num id=v11007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>All the doorways and windows had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.</p><p id=p11007005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them.</p><p id=p11007006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters.</p><p id=p11007007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter whom he had taken in marriage.</p><p id=p11007008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court. <b class=verse-num id=v11007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v11007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar. <b class=verse-num id=v11007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD and the vestibule of the house.</p><h3 id=p11007012_05-1>The Temple Furnishings</h3><p id=p11007012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. <b class=verse-num id=v11007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.</p><p id=p11007014_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same. <b class=verse-num id=v11007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v11007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital. <b class=verse-num id=v11007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital. <b class=verse-num id=v11007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v11007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital. <b class=verse-num id=v11007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz. <b class=verse-num id=v11007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.</p><p id=p11007022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. <b class=verse-num id=v11007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. <b class=verse-num id=v11007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward. <b class=verse-num id=v11007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.</p><p id=p11007026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He also made the ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. <b class=verse-num id=v11007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames, <b class=verse-num id=v11007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work. <b class=verse-num id=v11007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each. <b class=verse-num id=v11007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round. <b class=verse-num id=v11007032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. <b class=verse-num id=v11007033-1>33&nbsp;</b>The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast. <b class=verse-num id=v11007034-1>34&nbsp;</b>There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands. <b class=verse-num id=v11007035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it. <b class=verse-num id=v11007036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. <b class=verse-num id=v11007037-1>37&nbsp;</b>After this manner he made the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.</p><p id=p11007037_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he made ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands. <b class=verse-num id=v11007039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.</p><p id=p11007039_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD: <b class=verse-num id=v11007041-1>41&nbsp;</b>the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars; <b class=verse-num id=v11007042-1>42&nbsp;</b>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars; <b class=verse-num id=v11007043-1>43&nbsp;</b>the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands; <b class=verse-num id=v11007044-1>44&nbsp;</b>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.</p><p id=p11007044_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v11007046-1>46&nbsp;</b>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. <b class=verse-num id=v11007047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.</p><p id=p11007047_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007048-1>48&nbsp;</b>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence, <b class=verse-num id=v11007049-1>49&nbsp;</b>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; <b class=verse-num id=v11007050-1>50&nbsp;</b>the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.</p><p id=p11007050_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</p></div>

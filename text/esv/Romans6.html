<h3 id=p45005001_01-1>Peace with God Through Faith</h3><p id=p45005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v45005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, <b class=verse-num id=v45005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, <b class=verse-num id=v45005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and hope does not put us to shame, because God&#8217;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</p><p id=p45005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. <b class=verse-num id=v45005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For one will scarcely die for a righteous person&#8212;though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. <b class=verse-num id=v45005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. <b class=verse-num id=v45005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</p><h3 id=p45005011_06-1>Death in Adam, Life in Christ</h3><p id=p45005011_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. <b class=verse-num id=v45005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</p><p id=p45005014_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man&#8217;s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. <b class=verse-num id=v45005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the free gift is not like the result of that one man&#8217;s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. <b class=verse-num id=v45005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For if, because of one man&#8217;s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</p><p id=p45005017_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. <b class=verse-num id=v45005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For as by the one man&#8217;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&#8217;s obedience the many will be made righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v45005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, <b class=verse-num id=v45005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45006001_01-1>Dead to Sin, Alive to God</h3><p id=p45006001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? <b class=verse-num id=v45006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? <b class=verse-num id=v45006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <b class=verse-num id=v45006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p><p id=p45006004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. <b class=verse-num id=v45006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For one who has died has been set free from sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. <b class=verse-num id=v45006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. <b class=verse-num id=v45006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. <b class=verse-num id=v45006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p><p id=p45006011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. <b class=verse-num id=v45006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</p><h3 id=p45006014_07-1>Slaves to Righteousness</h3><p id=p45006014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! <b class=verse-num id=v45006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? <b class=verse-num id=v45006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, <b class=verse-num id=v45006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</p><p id=p45006019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. <b class=verse-num id=v45006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. <b class=verse-num id=v45006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45007001_01-1>Released from the Law</h3><p id=p45007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know, brothers&#8212;for I am speaking to those who know the law&#8212;that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? <b class=verse-num id=v45007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. <b class=verse-num id=v45007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</p><p id=p45007003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. <b class=verse-num id=v45007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. <b class=verse-num id=v45007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.</p><h3 id=p45007006_05-1>The Law and Sin</h3><p id=p45007006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, &#8220;You shall not covet.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. <b class=verse-num id=v45007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. <b class=verse-num id=v45007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. <b class=verse-num id=v45007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. <b class=verse-num id=v45007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</p><p id=p45007012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. <b class=verse-num id=v45007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. <b class=verse-num id=v45007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. <b class=verse-num id=v45007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. <b class=verse-num id=v45007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. <b class=verse-num id=v45007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. <b class=verse-num id=v45007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</p><p id=p45007020_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. <b class=verse-num id=v45007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, <b class=verse-num id=v45007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. <b class=verse-num id=v45007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? <b class=verse-num id=v45007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p></div>

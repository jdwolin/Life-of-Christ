Its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a great sword.</p><p id=p66006004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v66006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, &#8220;Come!&#8221; And I looked, and behold, a black horse!

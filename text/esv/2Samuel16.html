<h3 id=p10015001_01-1>Absalom&#8217;s Conspiracy</h3><p id=p10015001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. <b class=verse-num id=v10015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, &#8220;From what city are you?&#8221; And when he said, &#8220;Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Absalom would say to him, &#8220;See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom would say, &#8220;Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. <b class=verse-num id=v10015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p><p id=p10015006_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, &#8220;Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron. <b class=verse-num id=v10015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, &#8216;If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The king said to him, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; So he arose and went to Hebron. <b class=verse-num id=v10015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &#8220;As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, &#8216;Absalom is king at Hebron!&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v10015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&#8217;s counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.</p><h3 id=p10015012_03-1>David Flees Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10015012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And a messenger came to David, saying, &#8220;The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, &#8220;Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the king&#8217;s servants said to the king, &#8220;Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house. <b class=verse-num id=v10015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king went out, and all the people after him. And they halted at the last house.</p><p id=p10015017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king. <b class=verse-num id=v10015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, &#8220;Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home. <b class=verse-num id=v10015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go I know not where? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Ittai answered the king, &#8220;As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David said to Ittai, &#8220;Go then, pass on.&#8221; So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.</p><p id=p10015023_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city. <b class=verse-num id=v10015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Zadok, &#8220;Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place. <b class=verse-num id=v10015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But if he says, &#8216;I have no pleasure in you,&#8217; behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The king also said to Zadok the priest, &#8220;Are you not a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. <b class=verse-num id=v10015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.</p><p id=p10015029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went. <b class=verse-num id=v10015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And it was told David, &#8220;Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.&#8221; And David said, &#8220;O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.&#8221;</p><p id=p10015031_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head. <b class=verse-num id=v10015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>David said to him, &#8220;If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. <b class=verse-num id=v10015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, &#8216;I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father&#8217;s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,&#8217; then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. <b class=verse-num id=v10015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king&#8217;s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. <b class=verse-num id=v10015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok&#8217;s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar&#8217;s son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>So Hushai, David&#8217;s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.</p></div>

See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood.&#8221;</p><p id=p10016008_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, &#8220;Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But the king said, &#8220;What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, &#8216;Curse David,&#8217; who then shall say, &#8216;Why have you done so?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, &#8220;Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to. <b class=verse-num id=v10016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust. <b class=verse-num id=v10016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan. And there he refreshed himself.</p><h3 id=p10016014_07-1>Absalom Enters Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10016014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when Hushai the Archite, David&#8217;s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, &#8220;Long live the king! Long live the king!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Absalom said to Hushai, &#8220;Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Hushai said to Absalom, &#8220;No, for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain. <b class=verse-num id=v10016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you.&#8221;</p><p id=p10016019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, &#8220;Give your counsel. What shall we do?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Ahithophel said to Absalom, &#8220;Go in to your father&#8217;s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof. And Absalom went in to his father&#8217;s concubines in the sight of all Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10017001_01-1>Hushai Saves David</h3><p id=p10017001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Ahithophel said to Absalom, &#8220;Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. <b class=verse-num id=v10017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged and throw him into a panic, and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king, <b class=verse-num id=v10017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.</p><p id=p10017004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, &#8220;Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, &#8220;Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he says? If not, you speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Hushai said to Absalom, &#8220;This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Hushai said, &#8220;You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people. <b class=verse-num id=v10017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And as soon as some of the people fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, &#8216;There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men. <b class=verse-num id=v10017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. <b class=verse-num id=v10017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and all the men with him not one will be left. <b class=verse-num id=v10017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, &#8220;The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.&#8221; For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring harm upon Absalom.</p><p id=p10017014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, &#8220;Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so have I counseled. <b class=verse-num id=v10017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send quickly and tell David, &#8216;Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel. A female servant was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they were not to be seen entering the city. <b class=verse-num id=v10017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. And they went down into it. <b class=verse-num id=v10017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well&#8217;s mouth and scattered grain on it, and nothing was known of it. <b class=verse-num id=v10017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Absalom&#8217;s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, &#8220;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&#8221; And the woman said to them, &#8220;They have gone over the brook of water.&#8221; And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p10017020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, &#8220;Arise, and go quickly over the water, for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</p><p id=p10017022_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.</p><p id=p10017023_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had married Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s mother. <b class=verse-num id=v10017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</p><p id=p10017026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, <b class=verse-num id=v10017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils, <b class=verse-num id=v10017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat, for they said, &#8220;The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.&#8221;</p></div>

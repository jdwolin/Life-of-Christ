But he cried out all the more, &#8220;Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;What do you want me to do for you?&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;Lord, let me recover my sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God.

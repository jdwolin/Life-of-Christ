<h3 id=p06008001_01-1>The Fall of Ai</h3><p id=p06008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land. <b class=verse-num id=v06008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city, behind it.&#8221;</p><p id=p06008002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night. <b class=verse-num id=v06008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he commanded them, &#8220;Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you remain ready. <b class=verse-num id=v06008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us just as before, we shall flee before them. <b class=verse-num id=v06008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will say, &#8216;They are fleeing from us, just as before.&#8217; So we will flee before them. <b class=verse-num id=v06008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will give it into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v06008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And as soon as you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire. You shall do according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Joshua sent them out. And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, but Joshua spent that night among the people.</p><p id=p06008009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. <b class=verse-num id=v06008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai. <b class=verse-num id=v06008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley. <b class=verse-num id=v06008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the men of the city, hurried and went out early to the appointed place toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v06008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.</p><p id=p06008017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.&#8221; And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it. And they hurried to set the city on fire. <b class=verse-num id=v06008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers. <b class=verse-num id=v06008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. <b class=verse-num id=v06008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And Israel struck them down, until there was left none that survived or escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v06008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him near to Joshua.</p><p id=p06008023_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v06008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000, all the people of Ai. <b class=verse-num id=v06008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction. <b class=verse-num id=v06008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of the LORD that he commanded Joshua. <b class=verse-num id=v06008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v06008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.</p><h3 id=p06008029_05-1>Joshua Renews the Covenant</h3><p id=p06008029_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>At that time Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, <b class=verse-num id=v06008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, &#8220;an altar of uncut stones, upon which no man has wielded an iron tool.&#8221; And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v06008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. <b class=verse-num id=v06008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And all Israel, sojourner as well as native born, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. <b class=verse-num id=v06008035-1>35&nbsp;</b>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.</p></div>

<h3 id=p06009001_01-1>The Gibeonite Deception</h3><p id=p06009001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this, <b class=verse-num id=v06009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel.</p><p id=p06009002_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v06009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, <b class=verse-num id=v06009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended, <b class=verse-num id=v06009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes. And all their provisions were dry and crumbly. <b class=verse-num id=v06009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, &#8220;We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, &#8220;Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They said to Joshua, &#8220;We are your servants.&#8221; And Joshua said to them, &#8220;Who are you? And where do you come from?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v06009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. <b class=verse-num id=v06009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, &#8216;Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, &#8220;We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly. <b class=verse-num id=v06009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the men took some of their provisions, but did not ask counsel from the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.</p><p id=p06009015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v06009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them. <b class=verse-num id=v06009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. <b class=verse-num id=v06009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders. <b class=verse-num id=v06009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But all the leaders said to all the congregation, &#8220;We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them. <b class=verse-num id=v06009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the leaders said to them, &#8220;Let them live.&#8221; So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.</p><p id=p06009021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v06009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, &#8220;Why did you deceive us, saying, &#8216;We are very far from you,&#8217; when you dwell among us? <b class=verse-num id=v06009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall never be anything but servants, cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>They answered Joshua, &#8220;Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you&#8212;so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing. <b class=verse-num id=v06009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us, do it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel, and they did not kill them. <b class=verse-num id=v06009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place that he should choose.</p></div>

For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.</p><p id=p06010005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, &#8220;Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. <b class=verse-num id=v06010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal. <b class=verse-num id=v06010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died.

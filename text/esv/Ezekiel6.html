<h3 id=p26005001_01-1>Jerusalem Will Be Destroyed</h3><p id=p26005001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber&#8217;s razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair. <b class=verse-num id=v26005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. <b class=verse-num id=v26005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe. <b class=verse-num id=v26005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.</p><p id=p26005004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries all around her. <b class=verse-num id=v26005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And she has rebelled against my rules by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries all around her; for they have rejected my rules and have not walked in my statutes. <b class=verse-num id=v26005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, and have not walked in my statutes or obeyed my rules, and have not even acted according to the rules of the nations that are all around you, <b class=verse-num id=v26005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against you. And I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations. <b class=verse-num id=v26005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again. <b class=verse-num id=v26005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds. <b class=verse-num id=v26005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will withdraw. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity. <b class=verse-num id=v26005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.</p><p id=p26005012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that I am the LORD&#8212;that I have spoken in my jealousy&#8212;when I spend my fury upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v26005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Moreover, I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations all around you and in the sight of all who pass by. <b class=verse-num id=v26005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes&#8212;I am the LORD; I have spoken&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v26005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread. <b class=verse-num id=v26005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken.&#8221;</p></div>

Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. <b class=verse-num id=v26006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols. <b class=verse-num id=v26006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. <b class=verse-num id=v26006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out. <b class=verse-num id=v26006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.</p><p id=p26006007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Yet I will leave some of you alive.

And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they shall know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.&#8221;</p><p id=p26006010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. <b class=verse-num id=v26006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v26006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols. <b class=verse-num id=v26006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and waste, in all their dwelling places, from the wilderness to Riblah.

The end has come upon the four corners of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v26007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</p><p id=p26007004_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes. <b class=verse-num id=v26007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes. <b class=verse-num id=v26007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains. <b class=verse-num id=v26007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity.

Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded. <b class=verse-num id=v26007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. <b class=verse-num id=v26007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v26007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life.</p><p id=p26007013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v26007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour. <b class=verse-num id=v26007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity. <b class=verse-num id=v26007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water. <b class=verse-num id=v26007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. <b class=verse-num id=v26007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity. <b class=verse-num id=v26007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them. <b class=verse-num id=v26007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it. <b class=verse-num id=v26007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it.</p><p id=p26007022_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Forge a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. <b class=verse-num id=v26007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned. <b class=verse-num id=v26007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none. <b class=verse-num id=v26007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders. <b class=verse-num id=v26007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

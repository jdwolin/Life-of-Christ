Untie it and bring it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011003-1>3&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If anyone says to you, &#8216;Why are you doing this?&#8217; say, &#8216;The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. <b class=verse-num id=v41011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And some of those standing there said to them, &#8220;What are you doing, untying the colt?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. <b class=verse-num id=v41011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. <b class=verse-num id=v41011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. <b class=verse-num id=v41011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, &#8220;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! <b class=verse-num id=v41011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!&#8221;</p><p id=p41011010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p><h3 id=p41011011_04-1>Jesus Curses the Fig Tree</h3><p id=p41011011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. <b class=verse-num id=v41011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <b class=verse-num id=v41011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said to it, <span class=woc>&#8220;May no one ever eat fruit from you again.&#8221;</span> And his disciples heard it.</p><h3 id=p41011014_09-1>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3><p id=p41011014_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. <b class=verse-num id=v41011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v41011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he was teaching them and saying to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Is it not written, &#8216;My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations&#8217;? But you have made it a den of robbers.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. <b class=verse-num id=v41011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when evening came they went out of the city.</p><h3 id=p41011019_13-1>The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree</h3><p id=p41011019_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. <b class=verse-num id=v41011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Peter remembered and said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have faith in God.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, &#8216;Be taken up and thrown into the sea,&#8217; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41011025_20-1>The Authority of Jesus Challenged</h3><p id=p41011025_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v41011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, <b class=verse-num id=v41011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>and they said to him, &#8220;By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41011030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they discussed it with one another, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; he will say, &#8216;Why then did you not believe him?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v41011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But shall we say, &#8216;From man&#8217;?&#8221;&#8212;they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v41011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they answered Jesus, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&#8221;</span></p></div>

For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why put me to the test?

You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. <b class=verse-num id=v41012033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one&#8217;s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41012034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span> And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p><h3 id=p41012034_19-1>Whose Son Is the Christ?</h3><p id=p41012034_24-1><b class=verse-num id=v41012035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41012036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared,</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p41012036_24-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</span><br /><span id=p41012036_24-1 class=line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sit at my right hand,</span><br /><span id=p41012036_24-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I put your enemies under your feet.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></span></p><p id=p41012036_24-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num woc id=v41012037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>David himself calls him Lord.

<h3 id=p09017001_01-1>David and Goliath</h3><p id=p09017001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. <b class=verse-num id=v09017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them. <b class=verse-num id=v09017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. <b class=verse-num id=v09017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v09017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. <b class=verse-num id=v09017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The shaft of his spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam, and his spear&#8217;s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, &#8220;Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. <b class=verse-num id=v09017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said, &#8220;I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</p><p id=p09017011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years. <b class=verse-num id=v09017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. <b class=verse-num id=v09017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul, <b class=verse-num id=v09017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father&#8217;s sheep at Bethlehem. <b class=verse-num id=v09017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.</p><p id=p09017016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesse said to David his son, &#8220;Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v09017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring some token from them.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry. <b class=verse-num id=v09017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. <b class=verse-num id=v09017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v09017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.</p><p id=p09017023_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v09017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel said, &#8220;Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father&#8217;s house free in Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And David said to the men who stood by him, &#8220;What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And the people answered him in the same way, &#8220;So shall it be done to the man who kills him.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017027_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab&#8217;s anger was kindled against David, and he said, &#8220;Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;What have I done now? Was it not but a word?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.</p><p id=p09017030_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Let no man&#8217;s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to David, &#8220;You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But David said to Saul, &#8220;Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, <b class=verse-num id=v09017035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221; And Saul said to David, &#8220;Go, and the LORD be with you!&#8221;</p><p id=p09017037_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail, <b class=verse-num id=v09017039-1>39&nbsp;</b>and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, &#8220;I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.&#8221; So David put them off. <b class=verse-num id=v09017040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd&#8217;s pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.</p><p id=p09017040_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. <b class=verse-num id=v09017042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v09017043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said to David, &#8220;Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?&#8221; And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <b class=verse-num id=v09017044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The Philistine said to David, &#8220;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the Philistine, &#8220;You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <b class=verse-num id=v09017046-1>46&nbsp;</b>This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v09017047-1>47&nbsp;</b>and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD&#8217;s, and he will give you into our hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p09017047_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017048-1>48&nbsp;</b>When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. <b class=verse-num id=v09017049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p><p id=p09017049_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017050-1>50&nbsp;</b>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David. <b class=verse-num id=v09017051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. <b class=verse-num id=v09017052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron. <b class=verse-num id=v09017053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. <b class=verse-num id=v09017054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</p><p id=p09017054_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09017055-1>55&nbsp;</b>As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, &#8220;Abner, whose son is this youth?&#8221; And Abner said, &#8220;As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017056-1>56&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Inquire whose son the boy is.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09017057-1>57&nbsp;</b>And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09017058-1>58&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Whose son are you, young man?&#8221; And David answered, &#8220;I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&#8221;</p></div>

And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul&#8217;s servants.</p><h3 id=p09018005_05-1>Saul&#8217;s Jealousy of David</h3><p id=p09018005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments. <b class=verse-num id=v09018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the women sang to one another as they celebrated,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p09018007_09-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Saul has struck down his thousands,</span><br /><span id=p09018007_09-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David his ten thousands.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p09018007_09-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v09018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, &#8220;They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Saul eyed David from that day on.</p><p id=p09018009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, &#8220;I will pin David to the wall.&#8221; But David evaded him twice.</p><p id=p09018011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v09018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people. <b class=verse-num id=v09018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David had success in all his undertakings, for the LORD was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v09018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him. <b class=verse-num id=v09018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</p><h3 id=p09018016_09-1>David Marries Michal</h3><p id=p09018016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to David, &#8220;Here is my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD&#8217;s battles.&#8221; For Saul thought, &#8220;Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father&#8217;s clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But at the time when Merab, Saul&#8217;s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.</p><p id=p09018019_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now Saul&#8217;s daughter Michal loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. <b class=verse-num id=v09018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Saul thought, &#8220;Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&#8221; Therefore Saul said to David a second time, &#8220;You shall now be my son-in-law.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Saul commanded his servants, &#8220;Speak to David in private and say, &#8216;Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king&#8217;s son-in-law.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Saul&#8217;s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, &#8220;Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king&#8217;s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the servants of Saul told him, &#8220;Thus and so did David speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, &#8220;Thus shall you say to David, &#8216;The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king&#8217;s enemies.&#8217;&#8221; Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king&#8217;s son-in-law. Before the time had expired, <b class=verse-num id=v09018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king&#8217;s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife. <b class=verse-num id=v09018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, loved him, <b class=verse-num id=v09018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David&#8217;s enemy continually.</p><p id=p09018029_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.</p></div>

And if I learn anything I will tell you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, &#8220;Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you. <b class=verse-num id=v09019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For he took his life in his hand and he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel.

But Michal, David&#8217;s wife, told him, &#8220;If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled away and escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v09019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats&#8217; hair at its head and covered it with the clothes. <b class=verse-num id=v09019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, &#8220;He is sick.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, &#8220;Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats&#8217; hair at its head. <b class=verse-num id=v09019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Saul said to Michal, &#8220;Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?&#8221; And Michal answered Saul, &#8220;He said to me, &#8216;Let me go. Why should I kill you?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p09019017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth. <b class=verse-num id=v09019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And it was told Saul, &#8220;Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. <b class=verse-num id=v09019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. <b class=verse-num id=v09019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, &#8220;Where are Samuel and David?&#8221; And one said, &#8220;Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah. <b class=verse-num id=v09019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said, &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</p></div>

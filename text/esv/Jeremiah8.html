Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v24007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v24007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer, <b class=verse-num id=v24007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. <b class=verse-num id=v24007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim.</p><p id=p24007015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you. <b class=verse-num id=v24007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? <b class=verse-num id=v24007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven. And they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v24007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Is it I whom they provoke? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own shame? <b class=verse-num id=v24007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched.&#8221;</p><p id=p24007020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v24007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. <b class=verse-num id=v24007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But this command I gave them: &#8216;Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v24007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. <b class=verse-num id=v24007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day. <b class=verse-num id=v24007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.</p><p id=p24007026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you. <b class=verse-num id=v24007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And you shall say to them, &#8216;This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p24007029_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v24007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Cut off your hair and cast it away;</span><br /><span id=p24007029_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raise a lamentation on the bare heights,</span><br /><span id=p24007029_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD has rejected and forsaken</span><br /><span id=p24007029_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the generation of his wrath.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p24007029_05-1>The Valley of Slaughter</h3><p id=p24007029_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v24007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the LORD. They have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. <b class=verse-num id=v24007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind. <b class=verse-num id=v24007032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere. <b class=verse-num id=v24007033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away. <b class=verse-num id=v24007034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.</p></div>

Now tell me,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they discussed it with one another, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; he will say, &#8216;Why did you not believe him?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v42020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if we say, &#8216;From man,&#8217; all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they answered that they did not know where it came from. <b class=verse-num id=v42020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42020008_06-1>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants</h3><p id=p42020008_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v42020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he began to tell the people this parable: <span class=woc>&#8220;A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then the owner of the vineyard said, &#8216;What shall I do?

Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.&#8221;</span> When they heard this, they said, &#8220;Surely not!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he looked directly at them and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;What then is this that is written:</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p42020017_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;The stone that the builders rejected</span><br /><span id=p42020017_12-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become the cornerstone&#8217;?</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></p><p id=p42020017_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num woc id=v42020018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42020018_12-1>Paying Taxes to Caesar</h3><p id=p42020018_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v42020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people. <b class=verse-num id=v42020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. <b class=verse-num id=v42020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they asked him, &#8220;Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. <b class=verse-num id=v42020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Caesar&#8217;s.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.</p><h3 id=p42020026_16-1>Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection</h3><p id=p42020026_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v42020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, <b class=verse-num id=v42020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>and they asked him a question, saying, &#8220;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&#8217;s brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v42020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Now there were seven brothers.

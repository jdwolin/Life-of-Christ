You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities. <b class=verse-num id=v24036007-1>7&nbsp;</b>It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p24036008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036009-1>9&nbsp;</b>In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v24036010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p24036010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, <b class=verse-num id=v24036012-1>12&nbsp;</b>he went down to the king&#8217;s house, into the secretary&#8217;s chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials. <b class=verse-num id=v24036013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v24036014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, &#8220;Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.&#8221; So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;Sit down and read it.&#8221; So Baruch read it to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, &#8220;We must report all these words to the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then they asked Baruch, &#8220;Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Baruch answered them, &#8220;He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the officials said to Baruch, &#8220;Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.&#8221;</p><p id=p24036019_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king. <b class=verse-num id=v24036021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king. <b class=verse-num id=v24036022-1>22&nbsp;</b>It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him. <b class=verse-num id=v24036023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot. <b class=verse-num id=v24036024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v24036025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king&#8217;s son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.</p><p id=p24036026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <b class=verse-num id=v24036028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. <b class=verse-num id=v24036029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, &#8220;Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night. <b class=verse-num id=v24036031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p24036031_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.</p></div>

For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038005-1>5&nbsp;</b>King Zedekiah said, &#8220;Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24038006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king&#8217;s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes.

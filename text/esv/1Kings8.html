<h3 id=p11007001_01-1>Solomon Builds His Palace</h3><p id=p11007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.</p><p id=p11007001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars. <b class=verse-num id=v11007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. <b class=verse-num id=v11007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers. <b class=verse-num id=v11007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>All the doorways and windows had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.</p><p id=p11007005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them.</p><p id=p11007006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters.</p><p id=p11007007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter whom he had taken in marriage.</p><p id=p11007008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court. <b class=verse-num id=v11007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v11007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar. <b class=verse-num id=v11007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD and the vestibule of the house.</p><h3 id=p11007012_05-1>The Temple Furnishings</h3><p id=p11007012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. <b class=verse-num id=v11007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.</p><p id=p11007014_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same. <b class=verse-num id=v11007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v11007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital. <b class=verse-num id=v11007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital. <b class=verse-num id=v11007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v11007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital. <b class=verse-num id=v11007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz. <b class=verse-num id=v11007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.</p><p id=p11007022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. <b class=verse-num id=v11007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. <b class=verse-num id=v11007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward. <b class=verse-num id=v11007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.</p><p id=p11007026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He also made the ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. <b class=verse-num id=v11007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames, <b class=verse-num id=v11007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work. <b class=verse-num id=v11007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each. <b class=verse-num id=v11007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round. <b class=verse-num id=v11007032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. <b class=verse-num id=v11007033-1>33&nbsp;</b>The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast. <b class=verse-num id=v11007034-1>34&nbsp;</b>There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands. <b class=verse-num id=v11007035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it. <b class=verse-num id=v11007036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. <b class=verse-num id=v11007037-1>37&nbsp;</b>After this manner he made the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.</p><p id=p11007037_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he made ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands. <b class=verse-num id=v11007039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.</p><p id=p11007039_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD: <b class=verse-num id=v11007041-1>41&nbsp;</b>the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars; <b class=verse-num id=v11007042-1>42&nbsp;</b>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars; <b class=verse-num id=v11007043-1>43&nbsp;</b>the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands; <b class=verse-num id=v11007044-1>44&nbsp;</b>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.</p><p id=p11007044_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze. <b class=verse-num id=v11007046-1>46&nbsp;</b>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. <b class=verse-num id=v11007047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.</p><p id=p11007047_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007048-1>48&nbsp;</b>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence, <b class=verse-num id=v11007049-1>49&nbsp;</b>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; <b class=verse-num id=v11007050-1>50&nbsp;</b>the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.</p><p id=p11007050_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11007051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</p></div>

And they are there to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v11008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v11008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v11008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.</p><h3 id=p11008011_07-1>Solomon Blesses the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span></h3><p id=p11008011_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v11008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Solomon said, &#8220;The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness. <b class=verse-num id=v11008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I have indeed built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood. <b class=verse-num id=v11008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v11008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there. But I chose David to be over my people Israel.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v11008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to David my father, &#8216;Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. <b class=verse-num id=v11008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made.

I have consecrated this house that you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time. <b class=verse-num id=v11009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules, <b class=verse-num id=v11009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, &#8216;You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, <b class=verse-num id=v11009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <b class=verse-num id=v11009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And this house will become a heap of ruins.

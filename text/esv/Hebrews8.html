<h3 id=p58007001_01-1>The Priestly Order of Melchizedek</h3><p id=p58007001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v58007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, <b class=verse-num id=v58007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. <b class=verse-num id=v58007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.</p><p id=p58007003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! <b class=verse-num id=v58007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v58007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. <b class=verse-num id=v58007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. <b class=verse-num id=v58007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. <b class=verse-num id=v58007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, <b class=verse-num id=v58007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</p><h3 id=p58007010_06-1>Jesus Compared to Melchizedek</h3><p id=p58007010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron? <b class=verse-num id=v58007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. <b class=verse-num id=v58007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v58007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</p><p id=p58007014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, <b class=verse-num id=v58007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. <b class=verse-num id=v58007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For it is witnessed of him,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58007017_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You are a priest forever,</span><br /><span id=p58007017_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58007017_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness <b class=verse-num id=v58007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>(for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</p><p id=p58007019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, <b class=verse-num id=v58007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58007021_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The Lord has sworn</span><br /><span id=p58007021_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will not change his mind,</span><br /><span id=p58007021_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8216;You are a priest forever.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58007021_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.</p><p id=p58007022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, <b class=verse-num id=v58007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. <b class=verse-num id=v58007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</p><p id=p58007025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v58007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. <b class=verse-num id=v58007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. <b class=verse-num id=v58007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</p></div>

For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, &#8220;See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises. <b class=verse-num id=v58008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.</p><p id=p58008007_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v58008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For he finds fault with them when he says:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58008008_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,</span><br /><span id=p58008008_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel</span><br /><span id=p58008008_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the house of Judah,</span><br /><span id=p58008009_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;not like the covenant that I made with their fathers</span><br /><span id=p58008009_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.</span><br /><span id=p58008009_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;For they did not continue in my covenant,</span><br /><span id=p58008009_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.</span><br /><span id=p58008010_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel</span><br /><span id=p58008010_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after those days, declares the Lord:</span><br /><span id=p58008010_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put my laws into their minds,</span><br /><span id=p58008010_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and write them on their hearts,</span><br /><span id=p58008010_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will be their God,</span><br /><span id=p58008010_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they shall be my people.</span><br /><span id=p58008011_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor</span><br /><span id=p58008011_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and each one his brother, saying, &#8216;Know the Lord,&#8217;</span><br /><span id=p58008011_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for they shall all know me,</span><br /><span id=p58008011_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the least of them to the greatest.</span><br /><span id=p58008012_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,</span><br /><span id=p58008012_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will remember their sins no more.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58008012_08-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete.

<h3 id=p58009001_01-1>The Earthly Holy Place</h3><p id=p58009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v58009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. <b class=verse-num id=v58009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. <b class=verse-num id=v58009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, <b class=verse-num id=v58009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron&#8217;s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v58009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p><p id=p58009005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, <b class=verse-num id=v58009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v58009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing <b class=verse-num id=v58009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, <b class=verse-num id=v58009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p><h3 id=p58009010_05-1>Redemption Through the Blood of Christ</h3><p id=p58009010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) <b class=verse-num id=v58009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. <b class=verse-num id=v58009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, <b class=verse-num id=v58009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p><p id=p58009014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v58009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. <b class=verse-num id=v58009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. <b class=verse-num id=v58009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. <b class=verse-num id=v58009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <b class=verse-num id=v58009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. <b class=verse-num id=v58009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p><p id=p58009022_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <b class=verse-num id=v58009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. <b class=verse-num id=v58009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, <b class=verse-num id=v58009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <b class=verse-num id=v58009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, <b class=verse-num id=v58009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p></div>

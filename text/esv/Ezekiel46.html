It shall be holy throughout its whole extent. <b class=verse-num id=v26045002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Of this a square plot of 500 by 500 cubits shall be for the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it. <b class=verse-num id=v26045003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And from this measured district you shall measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 broad, in which shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. <b class=verse-num id=v26045004-1>4&nbsp;</b>It shall be the holy portion of the land. It shall be for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and approach the LORD to minister to him, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. <b class=verse-num id=v26045005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Another section, 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits broad, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their possession for cities to live in.</p><p id=p26045005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26045006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign for the property of the city an area 5,000 cubits broad and 25,000 cubits long.

The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v26047002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.</p><p id=p26047002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26047003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep. <b class=verse-num id=v26047004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep. <b class=verse-num id=v26047005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. <b class=verse-num id=v26047006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen this?&#8221;</p><p id=p26047006_06-1>Then he led me back to the bank of the river. <b class=verse-num id=v26047007-1>7&nbsp;</b>As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. <b class=verse-num id=v26047008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh. <b class=verse-num id=v26047009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. <b class=verse-num id=v26047010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. <b class=verse-num id=v26047011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. <b class=verse-num id=v26047012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26047012_06-1>Division of the Land</h3><p id=p26047012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26047013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;This is the boundary by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel.

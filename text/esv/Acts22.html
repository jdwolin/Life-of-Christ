And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed <b class=verse-num id=v44021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</p><p id=p44021006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day. <b class=verse-num id=v44021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. <b class=verse-num id=v44021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <b class=verse-num id=v44021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And coming to us, he took Paul&#8217;s belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, &#8220;Thus says the Holy Spirit, &#8216;This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Paul answered, &#8220;What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, &#8220;Let the will of the Lord be done.&#8221;</p><p id=p44021014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</p><h3 id=p44021016_05-1>Paul Visits James</h3><p id=p44021016_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. <b class=verse-num id=v44021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. <b class=verse-num id=v44021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. <b class=verse-num id=v44021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, &#8220;You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law, <b class=verse-num id=v44021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs. <b class=verse-num id=v44021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. <b class=verse-num id=v44021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; <b class=verse-num id=v44021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law. <b class=verse-num id=v44021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.</p><h3 id=p44021026_08-1>Paul Arrested in the Temple</h3><p id=p44021026_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, <b class=verse-num id=v44021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>crying out, &#8220;Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v44021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. <b class=verse-num id=v44021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. <b class=verse-num id=v44021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44021033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. <b class=verse-num id=v44021034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. <b class=verse-num id=v44021035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, <b class=verse-num id=v44021036-1>36&nbsp;</b>for the mob of the people followed, crying out, &#8220;Away with him!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44021036_13-1>Paul Speaks to the People</h3><p id=p44021036_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021037-1>37&nbsp;</b>As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, &#8220;May I say something to you?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Do you know Greek? <b class=verse-num id=v44021038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Paul replied, &#8220;I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:</p></div>

And he said:</p><p id=p44022002_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. <b class=verse-num id=v44022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, <b class=verse-num id=v44022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.</p><p id=p44022005_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me. <b class=verse-num id=v44022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I answered, &#8216;Who are you, Lord?&#8217; And he said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me. <b class=verse-num id=v44022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8216;What shall I do, Lord?&#8217; And the Lord said to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.</p><p id=p44022011_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, <b class=verse-num id=v44022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>came to me, and standing by me said to me, &#8216;Brother Saul, receive your sight.&#8217; And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him. <b class=verse-num id=v44022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8216;The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth; <b class=verse-num id=v44022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard. <b class=verse-num id=v44022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And now why do you wait?

<p id=p44023001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44023001-1>23:1&nbsp;</b>And looking intently at the council, Paul said, &#8220;Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v44023003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Paul said to him, &#8220;God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Those who stood by said, &#8220;Would you revile God&#8217;s high priest?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, &#8216;You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p44023005_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, &#8220;Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. <b class=verse-num id=v44023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. <b class=verse-num id=v44023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees&#8217; party stood up and contended sharply, &#8220;We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</p><p id=p44023010_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The following night the Lord stood by him and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p44023011_01-1>A Plot to Kill Paul</h3><p id=p44023011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. <b class=verse-num id=v44023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, &#8220;We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly.

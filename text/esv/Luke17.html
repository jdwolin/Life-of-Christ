<h3 id=p42016001_01-1>The Parable of the Dishonest Manager</h3><p id=p42016001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v42016001-1>16:1&nbsp;</b>He also said to the disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016002-1>2&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he called him and said to him, &#8216;What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016003-1>3&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the manager said to himself, &#8216;What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So, summoning his master&#8217;s debtors one by one, he said to the first, &#8216;How much do you owe my master?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He said, &#8216;A hundred measures of oil.&#8217; He said to him, &#8216;Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then he said to another, &#8216;And how much do you owe?&#8217; He said, &#8216;A hundred measures of wheat.&#8217; He said to him, &#8216;Take your bill, and write eighty.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</span></p><p id=p42016009_07-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v42016010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another&#8217;s, who will give you that which is your own?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42016013_07-1>The Law and the Kingdom of God</h3><p id=p42016013_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v42016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. <b class=verse-num id=v42016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts.

Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham&#8217;s side. The rich man also died and was buried,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he called out, &#8216;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But Abraham said, &#8216;Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said, &#8216;Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father&#8217;s house&#8212;</span><b class=verse-num woc id=v42016028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for I have five brothers&#8212;so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But Abraham said, &#8216;They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said, &#8216;No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42016031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He said to him, &#8216;If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p></div>

<h3 id=p58009001_01-1>The Earthly Holy Place</h3><p id=p58009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v58009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. <b class=verse-num id=v58009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. <b class=verse-num id=v58009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, <b class=verse-num id=v58009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron&#8217;s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v58009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p><p id=p58009005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, <b class=verse-num id=v58009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v58009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing <b class=verse-num id=v58009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, <b class=verse-num id=v58009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p><h3 id=p58009010_05-1>Redemption Through the Blood of Christ</h3><p id=p58009010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) <b class=verse-num id=v58009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. <b class=verse-num id=v58009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, <b class=verse-num id=v58009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p><p id=p58009014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v58009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. <b class=verse-num id=v58009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. <b class=verse-num id=v58009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. <b class=verse-num id=v58009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <b class=verse-num id=v58009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. <b class=verse-num id=v58009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p><p id=p58009022_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v58009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <b class=verse-num id=v58009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. <b class=verse-num id=v58009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, <b class=verse-num id=v58009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <b class=verse-num id=v58009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, <b class=verse-num id=v58009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p></div>

And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. <b class=verse-num id=v58011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. <b class=verse-num id=v58011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. <b class=verse-num id=v58011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

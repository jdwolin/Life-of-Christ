Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to him, &#8220;But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. <b class=verse-num id=v07006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I will stay till you return.&#8221;</p><p id=p07006018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour.

To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</p><p id=p07006024_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>That night the LORD said to him, &#8220;Take your father&#8217;s bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it <b class=verse-num id=v07006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.</p><h3 id=p07006027_08-1>Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal</h3><p id=p07006027_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v07006028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. <b class=verse-num id=v07006029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And they said to one another, &#8220;Who has done this thing?&#8221; And after they had searched and inquired, they said, &#8220;Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then the men of the town said to Joash, &#8220;Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But Joash said to all who stood against him, &#8220;Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, &#8220;Let Baal contend against him,&#8221; because he broke down his altar.</p><p id=p07006032_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v07006033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. <b class=verse-num id=v07006034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. <b class=verse-num id=v07006035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.</p><h3 id=p07006035_14-1>The Sign of the Fleece</h3><p id=p07006035_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v07006036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon said to God, &#8220;If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, <b class=verse-num id=v07006037-1>37&nbsp;</b>behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. <b class=verse-num id=v07006039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon said to God, &#8220;Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07006040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.</p></div>

<h3 id=p07007001_01-1>Gideon&#8217;s Three Hundred Men</h3><p id=p07007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p><p id=p07007001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, &#8216;My own hand has saved me.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v07007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, &#8216;Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.&#8217;&#8221; Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.</p><p id=p07007003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, &#8216;This one shall go with you,&#8217; shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, &#8216;This one shall not go with you,&#8217; shall not go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. <b class=verse-num id=v07007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Gideon, &#8220;With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</p><p id=p07007008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>That same night the LORD said to him, &#8220;Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v07007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v07007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.&#8221; Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v07007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance. <b class=verse-num id=v07007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, &#8220;Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And his comrade answered, &#8220;This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp.&#8221;</p><p id=p07007014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, &#8220;Arise, for the LORD has given the host of Midian into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars. <b class=verse-num id=v07007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. <b class=verse-num id=v07007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, &#8216;For the LORD and for Gideon.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3 id=p07007018_05-1>Gideon Defeats Midian</h3><p id=p07007018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v07007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, &#8220;A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled. <b class=verse-num id=v07007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When they blew the 300 trumpets, the LORD set every man&#8217;s sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v07007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.</p><p id=p07007023_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v07007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, &#8220;Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.&#8221; So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v07007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09014001_01-1>Jonathan Defeats the Philistines</h3><p id=p09014001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, &#8220;Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.&#8221; But he did not tell his father. <b class=verse-num id=v09014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men, <b class=verse-num id=v09014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod&#8217;s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. <b class=verse-num id=v09014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <b class=verse-num id=v09014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</p><p id=p09014005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, &#8220;Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And his armor-bearer said to him, &#8220;Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said, &#8220;Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. <b class=verse-num id=v09014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If they say to us, &#8216;Wait until we come to you,&#8217; then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. <b class=verse-num id=v09014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But if they say, &#8216;Come up to us,&#8217; then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, &#8220;Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, &#8220;Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.&#8221; And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, &#8220;Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him. <b class=verse-num id=v09014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow&#8217;s length in an acre of land. <b class=verse-num id=v09014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.</p><p id=p09014015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there. <b class=verse-num id=v09014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, &#8220;Count and see who has gone from us.&#8221; And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. <b class=verse-num id=v09014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So Saul said to Ahijah, &#8220;Bring the ark of God here.&#8221; For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v09014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, &#8220;Withdraw your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine&#8217;s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. <b class=verse-num id=v09014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <b class=verse-num id=v09014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. <b class=verse-num id=v09014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.</p><h3 id=p09014023_05-1>Saul&#8217;s Rash Vow</h3><p id=p09014023_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, &#8220;Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.&#8221; So none of the people had tasted food. <b class=verse-num id=v09014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now when all the people came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v09014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. <b class=verse-num id=v09014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright. <b class=verse-num id=v09014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then one of the people said, &#8220;Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, &#8216;Cursed be the man who eats food this day.&#8217;&#8221; And the people were faint. <b class=verse-num id=v09014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said, &#8220;My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey. <b class=verse-num id=v09014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.&#8221;</p><p id=p09014030_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint. <b class=verse-num id=v09014032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood. <b class=verse-num id=v09014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then they told Saul, &#8220;Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, &#8216;Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.&#8217;&#8221; So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there. <b class=verse-num id=v09014035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</p><p id=p09014035_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, &#8220;Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Do whatever seems good to you.&#8221; But the priest said, &#8220;Let us draw near to God here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And Saul inquired of God, &#8220;Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?&#8221; But he did not answer him that day. <b class=verse-num id=v09014038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today. <b class=verse-num id=v09014039-1>39&nbsp;</b>For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.&#8221; But there was not a man among all the people who answered him. <b class=verse-num id=v09014040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Then he said to all Israel, &#8220;You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.&#8221; And the people said to Saul, &#8220;Do what seems good to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Therefore Saul said, &#8220;O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.&#8221; And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v09014042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, &#8220;Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.&#8221; And Jonathan was taken.</p><p id=p09014042_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to Jonathan, &#8220;Tell me what you have done.&#8221; And Jonathan told him, &#8220;I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09014045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then the people said to Saul, &#8220;Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.&#8221; So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die. <b class=verse-num id=v09014046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</p><h3 id=p09014046_08-1>Saul Fights Israel&#8217;s Enemies</h3><p id=p09014046_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014047-1>47&nbsp;</b>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them. <b class=verse-num id=v09014048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.</p><p id=p09014048_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal. <b class=verse-num id=v09014050-1>50&nbsp;</b>And the name of Saul&#8217;s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul&#8217;s uncle. <b class=verse-num id=v09014051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</p><p id=p09014051_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v09014052-1>52&nbsp;</b>There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.</p></div>

Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p09015003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v09015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. <b class=verse-num id=v09015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to the Kenites, &#8220;Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&#8221; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <b class=verse-num id=v09015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v09015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v09015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.</p><p id=p09015009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to Samuel: <b class=verse-num id=v09015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.&#8221; And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night. <b class=verse-num id=v09015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, &#8220;Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, &#8220;Blessed be you to the LORD.

And he said, &#8220;Neither has the LORD chosen this one.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;The LORD has not chosen these.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Are all your sons here?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.&#8221; And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, &#8220;Arise, anoint him, for this is he.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</p><h3 id=p09016013_04-1>David in Saul&#8217;s Service</h3><p id=p09016013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him. <b class=verse-num id=v09016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Saul&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you. <b class=verse-num id=v09016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Let our lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Saul said to his servants, &#8220;Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>One of the young men answered, &#8220;Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, and the LORD is with him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, &#8220;Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v09016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer. <b class=verse-num id=v09016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &#8220;Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.</p></div>

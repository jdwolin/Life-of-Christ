<h3 id=p59002001_01-1>The Sin of Partiality</h3><p id=p59002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v59002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. <b class=verse-num id=v59002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, <b class=verse-num id=v59002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, &#8220;You sit here in a good place,&#8221; while you say to the poor man, &#8220;You stand over there,&#8221; or, &#8220;Sit down at my feet,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v59002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? <b class=verse-num id=v59002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? <b class=verse-num id=v59002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? <b class=verse-num id=v59002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?</p><p id=p59002007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v59002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&#8221; you are doing well. <b class=verse-num id=v59002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. <b class=verse-num id=v59002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. <b class=verse-num id=v59002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For he who said, &#8220;Do not commit adultery,&#8221; also said, &#8220;Do not murder.&#8221; If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. <b class=verse-num id=v59002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. <b class=verse-num id=v59002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p><h3 id=p59002013_05-1>Faith Without Works Is Dead</h3><p id=p59002013_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v59002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? <b class=verse-num id=v59002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <b class=verse-num id=v59002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and one of you says to them, &#8220;Go in peace, be warmed and filled,&#8221; without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? <b class=verse-num id=v59002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</p><p id=p59002017_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v59002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But someone will say, &#8220;You have faith and I have works.&#8221; Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. <b class=verse-num id=v59002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe&#8212;and shudder! <b class=verse-num id=v59002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? <b class=verse-num id=v59002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? <b class=verse-num id=v59002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; <b class=verse-num id=v59002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, &#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness&#8221;&#8212;and he was called a friend of God. <b class=verse-num id=v59002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. <b class=verse-num id=v59002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? <b class=verse-num id=v59002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.</p></div>

<h3 id=p59003001_01-1>Taming the Tongue</h3><p id=p59003001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v59003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. <b class=verse-num id=v59003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. <b class=verse-num id=v59003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. <b class=verse-num id=v59003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. <b class=verse-num id=v59003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.</p><p id=p59003005_04-1>How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! <b class=verse-num id=v59003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. <b class=verse-num id=v59003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, <b class=verse-num id=v59003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. <b class=verse-num id=v59003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. <b class=verse-num id=v59003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. <b class=verse-num id=v59003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? <b class=verse-num id=v59003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.</p><h3 id=p59003012_04-1>Wisdom from Above</h3><p id=p59003012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v59003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. <b class=verse-num id=v59003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v59003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. <b class=verse-num id=v59003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. <b class=verse-num id=v59003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. <b class=verse-num id=v59003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</p></div>

<h3 id=p59004001_01-1>Warning Against Worldliness</h3><p id=p59004001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v59004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? <b class=verse-num id=v59004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. <b class=verse-num id=v59004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. <b class=verse-num id=v59004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. <b class=verse-num id=v59004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, &#8220;He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v59004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v59004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <b class=verse-num id=v59004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. <b class=verse-num id=v59004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. <b class=verse-num id=v59004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p><p id=p59004010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v59004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. <b class=verse-num id=v59004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</p><h3 id=p59004012_04-1>Boasting About Tomorrow</h3><p id=p59004012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v59004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Come now, you who say, &#8220;Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v59004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. <b class=verse-num id=v59004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Instead you ought to say, &#8220;If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v59004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. <b class=verse-num id=v59004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.</p></div>

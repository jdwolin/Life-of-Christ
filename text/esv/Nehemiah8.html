So they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</p><p id=p16009025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. <b class=verse-num id=v16009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. And in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v16009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But after they had rest they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies. <b class=verse-num id=v16009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, which if a person does them, he shall live by them, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey. <b class=verse-num id=v16009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. <b class=verse-num id=v16009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.</p><p id=p16009031_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. <b class=verse-num id=v16009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly. <b class=verse-num id=v16009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them. <b class=verse-num id=v16009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Even in their own kingdom, and amid your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works. <b class=verse-num id=v16009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. <b class=verse-num id=v16009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress.</p><p id=p16009037_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Because of all this we make a firm covenant in writing; on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.</p></div>

As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the sons of Levi. <b class=verse-num id=v15008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of insight, <b class=verse-num id=v15008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers and the temple servants at the place Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God. <b class=verse-num id=v15008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And by the good hand of our God on us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, 18; <b class=verse-num id=v15008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>also Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his kinsmen and their sons, 20; <b class=verse-num id=v15008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>besides 220 of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name.</p><h3 id=p15008020_12-1>Fasting and Prayer for Protection</h3><p id=p15008020_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v15008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our goods. <b class=verse-num id=v15008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king, &#8220;The hand of our God is for good on all who seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So we fasted and implored our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.</p><h3 id=p15008023_17-1>Priests to Guard Offerings</h3><p id=p15008023_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v15008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them. <b class=verse-num id=v15008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered. <b class=verse-num id=v15008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I weighed out into their hand 650 talents of silver, and silver vessels worth 200 talents, and 100 talents of gold, <b class=verse-num id=v15008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>20 bowls of gold worth 1,000 darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold. <b class=verse-num id=v15008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And I said to them, &#8220;You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v15008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers&#8217; houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.</p><p id=p15008030_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v15008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way. <b class=verse-num id=v15008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days. <b class=verse-num id=v15008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui. <b class=verse-num id=v15008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.</p><p id=p15008034_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v15008035-1>35&nbsp;</b>At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v15008036-1>36&nbsp;</b>They also delivered the king&#8217;s commissions to the king&#8217;s satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and they aided the people and the house of God.</p></div>

<h3 id=p15009001_01-1>Ezra Prays About Intermarriage</h3><p id=p15009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v15009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, &#8220;The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. <b class=verse-num id=v15009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>As soon as I heard this, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled. <b class=verse-num id=v15009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v15009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garment and my cloak torn, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God, <b class=verse-num id=v15009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>saying:</p><p id=p15009006_05-1>&#8220;O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens. <b class=verse-num id=v15009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as it is today. <b class=verse-num id=v15009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a secure hold within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery. <b class=verse-num id=v15009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection in Judea and Jerusalem.</p><p id=p15009009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v15009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, <b class=verse-num id=v15009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, &#8216;The land that you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness. <b class=verse-num id=v15009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v15009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant as this, <b class=verse-num id=v15009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>shall we break your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would you not be angry with us until you consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? <b class=verse-num id=v15009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>O LORD, the God of Israel, you are just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p15010001_01-1>The People Confess Their Sin</h3><p id=p15010001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v15010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel, for the people wept bitterly. <b class=verse-num id=v15010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: &#8220;We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. <b class=verse-num id=v15010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law. <b class=verse-num id=v15010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.</p><p id=p15010005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v15010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib, where he spent the night, neither eating bread nor drinking water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles. <b class=verse-num id=v15010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v15010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and that if anyone did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles.</p><p id=p15010008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v15010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain. <b class=verse-num id=v15010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, &#8220;You have broken faith and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v15010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now then make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, &#8220;It is so; we must do as you have said. <b class=verse-num id=v15010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. <b class=verse-num id=v15010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Let our officials stand for the whole assembly. Let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.</p><p id=p15010015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v15010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the returned exiles did so.

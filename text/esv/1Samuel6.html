So they took Dagon and put him back in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v09005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him. <b class=verse-num id=v09005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</p><p id=p09005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory. <b class=verse-num id=v09005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, &#8220;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.&#8221; So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there. <b class=verse-num id=v09005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them. <b class=verse-num id=v09005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, &#8220;They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, &#8220;Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.&#8221; For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there. <b class=verse-num id=v09005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09006001_01-1>The Ark Returned to Israel</h3><p id=p09006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. <b class=verse-num id=v09006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords. <b class=verse-num id=v09006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land. <b class=verse-num id=v09006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed? <b class=verse-num id=v09006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them. <b class=verse-num id=v09006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way <b class=verse-num id=v09006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.&#8221;</p><p id=p09006009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home. <b class=verse-num id=v09006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors. <b class=verse-num id=v09006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh. <b class=verse-num id=v09006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it. <b class=verse-num id=v09006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.</p><p id=p09006016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron, <b class=verse-num id=v09006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.</p><p id=p09006018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow. <b class=verse-num id=v09006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, &#8220;Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, &#8220;The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.&#8221;</p></div>

And they consecrated his son Eleazar to have charge of the ark of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.</p><h3 id=p09007002_01-1>Samuel Judges Israel</h3><p id=p09007002_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, &#8220;If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your heart to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the LORD only.</p><p id=p09007004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said, &#8220;Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there, &#8220;We have sinned against the LORD.&#8221; And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah. <b class=verse-num id=v09007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him. <b class=verse-num id=v09007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the LORD thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v09007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them, as far as below Beth-car.</p><p id=p09007011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v09007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen and called its name Ebenezer; for he said, &#8220;Till now the LORD has helped us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. <b class=verse-num id=v09007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines.

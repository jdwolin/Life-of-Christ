<h3 id=p09004001_01-1>The Philistines Capture the Ark</h3><p id=p09004001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.</p><p id=p09004001_06-1>Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. <b class=verse-num id=v09004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle. <b class=verse-num id=v09004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And when the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, &#8220;Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p><p id=p09004004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded. <b class=verse-num id=v09004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, &#8220;What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?&#8221; And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp, <b class=verse-num id=v09004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>the Philistines were afraid, for they said, &#8220;A god has come into the camp.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. <b class=verse-num id=v09004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v09004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.&#8221;</p><p id=p09004009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. <b class=verse-num id=v09004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</p><h3 id=p09004011_06-1>The Death of Eli</h3><p id=p09004011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. <b class=verse-num id=v09004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out. <b class=verse-num id=v09004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, &#8220;What is this uproar?&#8221; Then the man hurried and came and told Eli. <b class=verse-num id=v09004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see. <b class=verse-num id=v09004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the man said to Eli, &#8220;I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;How did it go, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He who brought the news answered and said, &#8220;Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</p><p id=p09004018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth, for her pains came upon her. <b class=verse-num id=v09004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son.&#8221; But she did not answer or pay attention. <b class=verse-num id=v09004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, &#8220;The glory has departed from Israel!&#8221; because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v09004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.&#8221;</p></div>

So they took Dagon and put him back in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v09005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him. <b class=verse-num id=v09005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</p><p id=p09005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory. <b class=verse-num id=v09005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, &#8220;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.&#8221; So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there. <b class=verse-num id=v09005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them. <b class=verse-num id=v09005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, &#8220;They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, &#8220;Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.&#8221; For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there. <b class=verse-num id=v09005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09006001_01-1>The Ark Returned to Israel</h3><p id=p09006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. <b class=verse-num id=v09006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords. <b class=verse-num id=v09006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land. <b class=verse-num id=v09006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed? <b class=verse-num id=v09006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them. <b class=verse-num id=v09006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way <b class=verse-num id=v09006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.&#8221;</p><p id=p09006009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home. <b class=verse-num id=v09006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors. <b class=verse-num id=v09006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh. <b class=verse-num id=v09006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it. <b class=verse-num id=v09006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.</p><p id=p09006016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron, <b class=verse-num id=v09006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.</p><p id=p09006018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow. <b class=verse-num id=v09006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, &#8220;Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, &#8220;The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.&#8221;</p></div>

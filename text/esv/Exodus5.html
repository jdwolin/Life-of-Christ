I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. <b class=verse-num id=v02004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do. <b class=verse-num id=v02004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him. <b class=verse-num id=v02004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02004017_05-1>Moses Returns to Egypt</h3><p id=p02004017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, &#8220;Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.&#8221; And Jethro said to Moses, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, &#8220;Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt.

It was then that she said, &#8220;A bridegroom of blood,&#8221; because of the circumcision.</p><p id=p02004026_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Aaron, &#8220;Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.&#8221; So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. <b class=verse-num id=v02004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do. <b class=verse-num id=v02004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v02004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v02004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.</p></div>

I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then they said, &#8220;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the king of Egypt said to them, &#8220;Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said, &#8220;Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, <b class=verse-num id=v02005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v02005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, &#8216;Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.&#8221;</p><p id=p02005009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, &#8220;Thus says Pharaoh, &#8216;I will not give you straw. <b class=verse-num id=v02005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. <b class=verse-num id=v02005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The taskmasters were urgent, saying, &#8220;Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh&#8217;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, &#8220;Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?&#8221;</p><p id=p02005014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, &#8220;Why do you treat your servants like this? <b class=verse-num id=v02005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, &#8216;Make bricks!&#8217; And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, &#8216;Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, &#8220;You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; <b class=verse-num id=v02005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and they said to them, &#8220;The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.&#8221;</p><p id=p02005021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, &#8220;O Lord, why have you done evil to this people?

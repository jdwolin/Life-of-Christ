<h3 id=p42023001_01-1>Jesus Before Pilate</h3><p id=p42023001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v42023001-1>23:1&nbsp;</b>Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. <b class=verse-num id=v42023002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And they began to accuse him, saying, &#8220;We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Pilate asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; And he answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, &#8220;I find no guilt in this man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But they were urgent, saying, &#8220;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p42023005_04-1>Jesus Before Herod</h3><p id=p42023005_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. <b class=verse-num id=v42023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when he learned that he belonged to Herod&#8217;s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. <b class=verse-num id=v42023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. <b class=verse-num id=v42023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. <b class=verse-num id=v42023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. <b class=verse-num id=v42023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. <b class=verse-num id=v42023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</p><p id=p42023012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <b class=verse-num id=v42023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. <b class=verse-num id=v42023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. <b class=verse-num id=v42023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I will therefore punish and release him.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p42023016_07-1>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</h3><p id=p42023016_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But they all cried out together, &#8220;Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v42023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder. <b class=verse-num id=v42023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v42023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but they kept shouting, &#8220;Crucify, crucify him!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023022-1>22&nbsp;</b>A third time he said to them, &#8220;Why? What evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. <b class=verse-num id=v42023024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. <b class=verse-num id=v42023025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.</p><h3 id=p42023025_13-1>The Crucifixion</h3><p id=p42023025_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v42023027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him. <b class=verse-num id=v42023028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But turning to them Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42023029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For behold, the days are coming when they will say, &#8216;Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42023030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, &#8216;Fall on us,&#8217; and to the hills, &#8216;Cover us.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42023031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42023031_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. <b class=verse-num id=v42023033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. <b class=verse-num id=v42023034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#8221;</span> And they cast lots to divide his garments. <b class=verse-num id=v42023035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, &#8220;He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023036-1>36&nbsp;</b>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine <b class=verse-num id=v42023037-1>37&nbsp;</b>and saying, &#8220;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023038-1>38&nbsp;</b>There was also an inscription over him, &#8220;This is the King of the Jews.&#8221;</p><p id=p42023038_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023039-1>39&nbsp;</b>One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, &#8220;Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But the other rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? <b class=verse-num id=v42023041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42023043_15-1>The Death of Jesus</h3><p id=p42023043_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023044-1>44&nbsp;</b>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, <b class=verse-num id=v42023045-1>45&nbsp;</b>while the sun&#8217;s light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. <b class=verse-num id=v42023046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!&#8221;</span> And having said this he breathed his last. <b class=verse-num id=v42023047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, &#8220;Certainly this man was innocent!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42023048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. <b class=verse-num id=v42023049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.</p><h3 id=p42023049_19-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p42023049_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea.

<h3 id=p42024001_01-1>The Resurrection</h3><p id=p42024001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v42024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. <b class=verse-num id=v42024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <b class=verse-num id=v42024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v42024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. <b class=verse-num id=v42024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, &#8220;Why do you seek the living among the dead? <b class=verse-num id=v42024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, <b class=verse-num id=v42024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And they remembered his words, <b class=verse-num id=v42024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. <b class=verse-num id=v42024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, <b class=verse-num id=v42024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p><h3 id=p42024012_03-1>On the Road to Emmaus</h3><p id=p42024012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v42024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v42024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <b class=verse-num id=v42024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#8221;</span> And they stood still, looking sad. <b class=verse-num id=v42024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#8220;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <b class=verse-num id=v42024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <b class=verse-num id=v42024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <b class=verse-num id=v42024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <b class=verse-num id=v42024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <b class=verse-num id=v42024024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p><p id=p42024027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <b class=verse-num id=v42024029-1>29&nbsp;</b>but they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <b class=verse-num id=v42024032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They said to each other, &#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <b class=verse-num id=v42024034-1>34&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p><h3 id=p42024035_08-1>Jesus Appears to His Disciples</h3><p id=p42024035_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Peace to you!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v42024038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <b class=verse-num id=v42024041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have you anything here to eat?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024042-1>42&nbsp;</b>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <b class=verse-num id=v42024043-1>43&nbsp;</b>and he took it and ate before them.</p><p id=p42024043_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Then he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, <b class=verse-num id=v42024046-1>46&nbsp;</b>and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024048-1>48&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024049-1>49&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42024049_13-1>The Ascension</h3><p id=p42024049_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024050-1>50&nbsp;</b>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024051-1>51&nbsp;</b>While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v42024052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <b class=verse-num id=v42024053-1>53&nbsp;</b>and were continually in the temple blessing God.</p></div>

Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, <b class=verse-num id=v42024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And they remembered his words, <b class=verse-num id=v42024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. <b class=verse-num id=v42024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, <b class=verse-num id=v42024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p><h3 id=p42024012_03-1>On the Road to Emmaus</h3><p id=p42024012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v42024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v42024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <b class=verse-num id=v42024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#8221;</span> And they stood still, looking sad. <b class=verse-num id=v42024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#8220;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <b class=verse-num id=v42024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <b class=verse-num id=v42024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <b class=verse-num id=v42024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <b class=verse-num id=v42024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <b class=verse-num id=v42024024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p><p id=p42024027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <b class=verse-num id=v42024029-1>29&nbsp;</b>but they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <b class=verse-num id=v42024032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They said to each other, &#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <b class=verse-num id=v42024034-1>34&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p><h3 id=p42024035_08-1>Jesus Appears to His Disciples</h3><p id=p42024035_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Peace to you!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v42024038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <b class=verse-num id=v42024041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have you anything here to eat?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024042-1>42&nbsp;</b>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <b class=verse-num id=v42024043-1>43&nbsp;</b>and he took it and ate before them.</p><p id=p42024043_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Then he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, <b class=verse-num id=v42024046-1>46&nbsp;</b>and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024048-1>48&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024049-1>49&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42024049_13-1>The Ascension</h3><p id=p42024049_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024050-1>50&nbsp;</b>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024051-1>51&nbsp;</b>While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v42024052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <b class=verse-num id=v42024053-1>53&nbsp;</b>and were continually in the temple blessing God.</p></div>

In the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land whose people were gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely, all of them. <b class=verse-num id=v26038009-1>9&nbsp;</b>You will advance, coming on like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.</p><p id=p26038009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26038010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day, thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme <b class=verse-num id=v26038011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and say, &#8216;I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26038012-1>12&nbsp;</b>to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v26038013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, &#8216;Have you come to seize spoil?

In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.</p><p id=p26038016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26038017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them? <b class=verse-num id=v26038018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But on that day, the day that Gog shall come against the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, my wrath will be roused in my anger. <b class=verse-num id=v26038019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26038020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the people who are on the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v26038021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. Every man&#8217;s sword will be against his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v26038022-1>22&nbsp;</b>With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur. <b class=verse-num id=v26038023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</p></div>

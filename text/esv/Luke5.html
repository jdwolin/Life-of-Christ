And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. <b class=verse-num id=v42005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class=woc>&#8220;Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Simon answered, &#8220;Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. <b class=verse-num id=v42005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. <b class=verse-num id=v42005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&#8217; knees, saying, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, <b class=verse-num id=v42005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</p><h3 id=p42005011_06-1>Jesus Cleanses a Leper</h3><p id=p42005011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v42005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy.

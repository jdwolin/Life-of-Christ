You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house. <b class=verse-num id=v26012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile. <b class=verse-num id=v26012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it. <b class=verse-num id=v26012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p26012006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.</p><p id=p26012007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>In the morning the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, &#8216;What are you doing?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Say, &#8216;I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v26012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there. <b class=verse-num id=v26012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. <b class=verse-num id=v26012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries. <b class=verse-num id=v26012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p26012016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety. <b class=verse-num id=v26012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink water in dismay. In this way her land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it. <b class=verse-num id=v26012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p26012020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, &#8216;The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing&#8217;? <b class=verse-num id=v26012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Tell them therefore, &#8216;Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.&#8217; But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision. <b class=verse-num id=v26012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For I am the LORD; I will speak the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p><p id=p26012025_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, &#8216;The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p></div>

They say, &#8216;Declares the LORD,&#8217; when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word. <b class=verse-num id=v26013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, &#8216;Declares the LORD,&#8217; although I have not spoken?&#8221;</p><p id=p26013007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, &#8216;Peace,&#8217; when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash, <b class=verse-num id=v26013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out. <b class=verse-num id=v26013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, &#8216;Where is the coating with which you smeared it?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end. <b class=verse-num id=v26013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it, <b class=verse-num id=v26013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26013016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them <b class=verse-num id=v26013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive? <b class=verse-num id=v26013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.</p><p id=p26013019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds. <b class=verse-num id=v26013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life, <b class=verse-num id=v26013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. <b class=verse-num id=v03010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean, <b class=verse-num id=v03010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the LORD has spoken to them by Moses.&#8221;</p><p id=p03010011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v03010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: &#8220;Take the grain offering that is left of the LORD&#8217;s food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy. <b class=verse-num id=v03010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons&#8217; due, from the LORD&#8217;s food offerings, for so I am commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v03010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons&#8217; due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v03010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons&#8217; with you as a due forever, as the LORD has commanded.&#8221;</p><p id=p03010015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v03010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v03010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? <b class=verse-num id=v03010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v03010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the LORD have approved?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v03010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when Moses heard that, he approved.</p></div>

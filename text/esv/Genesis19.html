<p id=p01018001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. <b class=verse-num id=v01018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth <b class=verse-num id=v01018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v01018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, <b class=verse-num id=v01018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on&#8212;since you have come to your servant.&#8221; So they said, &#8220;Do as you have said.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, &#8220;Quick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly. <b class=verse-num id=v01018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.</p><p id=p01018008_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v01018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;Where is Sarah your wife?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;She is in the tent.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The LORD said, &#8220;I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.&#8221; And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him. <b class=verse-num id=v01018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah. <b class=verse-num id=v01018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, &#8220;After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Abraham, &#8220;Why did Sarah laugh and say, &#8216;Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But Sarah denied it, saying, &#8220;I did not laugh,&#8221; for she was afraid. He said, &#8220;No, but you did laugh.&#8221;</p><p id=p01018015_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v01018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way. <b class=verse-num id=v01018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The LORD said, &#8220;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, <b class=verse-num id=v01018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? <b class=verse-num id=v01018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said, &#8220;Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, <b class=verse-num id=v01018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01018021_01-1>Abraham Intercedes for Sodom</h3><p id=p01018021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham drew near and said, &#8220;Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <b class=verse-num id=v01018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? <b class=verse-num id=v01018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said, &#8220;If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.&#8221;</p><p id=p01018026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Abraham answered and said, &#8220;Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. <b class=verse-num id=v01018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Again he spoke to him and said, &#8220;Suppose forty are found there.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;For the sake of forty I will not do it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I will not do it, if I find thirty there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01019001_01-1>God Rescues Lot</h3><p id=p01019001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth <b class=verse-num id=v01019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;My lords, please turn aside to your servant&#8217;s house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No; we will spend the night in the town square.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</p><p id=p01019003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. <b class=verse-num id=v01019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they called to Lot, &#8220;Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him, <b class=verse-num id=v01019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. <b class=verse-num id=v01019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But they said, &#8220;Stand back!&#8221; And they said, &#8220;This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.&#8221; Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. <b class=verse-num id=v01019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. <b class=verse-num id=v01019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.</p><p id=p01019011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the men said to Lot, &#8220;Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. <b class=verse-num id=v01019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, &#8220;Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city.&#8221; But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.</p><p id=p01019014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, &#8220;Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. <b class=verse-num id=v01019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And as they brought them out, one said, &#8220;Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Lot said to them, &#8220;Oh, no, my lords. <b class=verse-num id=v01019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. <b class=verse-num id=v01019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there&#8212;is it not a little one?&#8212;and my life will be saved!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>He said to him, &#8220;Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. <b class=verse-num id=v01019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there.&#8221; Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p><h3 id=p01019022_04-1>God Destroys Sodom</h3><p id=p01019022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. <b class=verse-num id=v01019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v01019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Lot&#8217;s wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</p><p id=p01019026_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.</p><p id=p01019028_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.</p><h3 id=p01019029_07-1>Lot and His Daughters</h3><p id=p01019029_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. <b class=verse-num id=v01019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the firstborn said to the younger, &#8220;Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v01019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</p><p id=p01019033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, &#8220;Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. <b class=verse-num id=v01019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. <b class=verse-num id=v01019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v01019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.</p></div>

So he said, &#8220;Lord, will you kill an innocent people? <b class=verse-num id=v01020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Did he not himself say to me, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;? And she herself said, &#8216;He is my brother.&#8217; In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then God said to him in the dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. <b class=verse-num id=v01020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now then, return the man&#8217;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live.

And the men were very much afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v01020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &#8220;What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What did you see, that you did this thing?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Abraham said, &#8220;I did it because I thought, &#8216;There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when God caused me to wander from my father&#8217;s house, I said to her, &#8216;This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, &#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01020013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Abimelech said, &#8220;Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>To Sarah he said, &#8220;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver.

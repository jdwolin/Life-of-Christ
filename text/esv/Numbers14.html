From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; <b class=verse-num id=v04013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; <b class=verse-num id=v04013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; <b class=verse-num id=v04013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; <b class=verse-num id=v04013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; <b class=verse-num id=v04013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; <b class=verse-num id=v04013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; <b class=verse-num id=v04013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi; <b class=verse-num id=v04013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; <b class=verse-num id=v04013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; <b class=verse-num id=v04013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; <b class=verse-num id=v04013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. <b class=verse-num id=v04013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</p><p id=p04013016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, &#8220;Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country, <b class=verse-num id=v04013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many, <b class=verse-num id=v04013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds, <b class=verse-num id=v04013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land.&#8221; Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.</p><p id=p04013020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. <b class=verse-num id=v04013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) <b class=verse-num id=v04013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs. <b class=verse-num id=v04013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.</p><h3 id=p04013024_05-1>Report of the Spies</h3><p id=p04013024_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land. <b class=verse-num id=v04013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v04013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And they told him, &#8220;We came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. <b class=verse-num id=v04013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there. <b class=verse-num id=v04013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country.

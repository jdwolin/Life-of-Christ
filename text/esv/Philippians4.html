<h3 id=p50003001_01-1>Righteousness Through Faith in Christ</h3><p id=p50003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v50003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.</p><p id=p50003001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v50003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v50003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v50003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: <b class=verse-num id=v50003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; <b class=verse-num id=v50003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. <b class=verse-num id=v50003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v50003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ <b class=verse-num id=v50003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v50003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, <b class=verse-num id=v50003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p><h3 id=p50003011_06-1>Straining Toward the Goal</h3><p id=p50003011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v50003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. <b class=verse-num id=v50003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, <b class=verse-num id=v50003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v50003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. <b class=verse-num id=v50003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</p><p id=p50003016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v50003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. <b class=verse-num id=v50003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v50003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. <b class=verse-num id=v50003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v50003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</p></div>

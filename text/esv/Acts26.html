<h3 id=p44025001_01-1>Paul Appeals to Caesar</h3><p id=p44025001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44025001-1>25:1&nbsp;</b>Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. <b class=verse-num id=v44025002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him, <b class=verse-num id=v44025003-1>3&nbsp;</b>asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem&#8212;because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way. <b class=verse-num id=v44025004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly. <b class=verse-num id=v44025005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44025005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44025006-1>6&nbsp;</b>After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. <b class=verse-num id=v44025007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove. <b class=verse-num id=v44025008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Paul argued in his defense, &#8220;Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, &#8220;Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Paul said, &#8220;I am standing before Caesar&#8217;s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well. <b class=verse-num id=v44025011-1>11&nbsp;</b>If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, &#8220;To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44025012_05-1>Paul Before Agrippa and Bernice</h3><p id=p44025012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44025013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. <b class=verse-num id=v44025014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul&#8217;s case before the king, saying, &#8220;There is a man left prisoner by Felix, <b class=verse-num id=v44025015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. <b class=verse-num id=v44025016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. <b class=verse-num id=v44025017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought. <b class=verse-num id=v44025018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed. <b class=verse-num id=v44025019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44025020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. <b class=verse-num id=v44025021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44025022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Agrippa said to Festus, &#8220;I would like to hear the man myself.&#8221; &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you will hear him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44025022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44025023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. <b class=verse-num id=v44025024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Festus said, &#8220;King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. <b class=verse-num id=v44025025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him. <b class=verse-num id=v44025026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. <b class=verse-num id=v44025027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p44026001_01-1>Paul&#8217;s Defense Before Agrippa</h3><p id=p44026001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44026001-1>26:1&nbsp;</b>So Agrippa said to Paul, &#8220;You have permission to speak for yourself.&#8221; Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:</p><p id=p44026001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews, <b class=verse-num id=v44026003-1>3&nbsp;</b>especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.</p><p id=p44026003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. <b class=verse-num id=v44026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v44026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! <b class=verse-num id=v44026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</p><p id=p44026008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <b class=verse-num id=v44026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. <b class=verse-num id=v44026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</p><h3 id=p44026011_05-1>Paul Tells of His Conversion</h3><p id=p44026011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. <b class=verse-num id=v44026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me. <b class=verse-num id=v44026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, <span class=woc>&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8216;Who are you, Lord?&#8217; And the Lord said, <span class=woc>&#8216;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44026016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44026017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles&#8212;to whom I am sending you</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44026018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.&#8217;</span></p><p id=p44026018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <b class=verse-num id=v44026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. <b class=verse-num id=v44026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. <b class=verse-num id=v44026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: <b class=verse-num id=v44026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.&#8221;</p><p id=p44026023_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, &#8220;Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But Paul said, &#8220;I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. <b class=verse-num id=v44026026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner. <b class=verse-num id=v44026027-1>27&nbsp;</b>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Agrippa said to Paul, &#8220;In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am&#8212;except for these chains.&#8221;</p><p id=p44026029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44026030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. <b class=verse-num id=v44026031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, &#8220;This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44026032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Agrippa said to Festus, &#8220;This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p44027001_01-1>Paul Sails for Rome</h3><p id=p44027001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44027001-1>27:1&nbsp;</b>And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius. <b class=verse-num id=v44027002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. <b class=verse-num id=v44027003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. <b class=verse-num id=v44027004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. <b class=verse-num id=v44027005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. <b class=verse-num id=v44027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board. <b class=verse-num id=v44027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. <b class=verse-num id=v44027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</p><p id=p44027008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, <b class=verse-num id=v44027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. <b class=verse-num id=v44027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.</p><h3 id=p44027012_05-1>The Storm at Sea</h3><p id=p44027012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44027013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore. <b class=verse-num id=v44027014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land. <b class=verse-num id=v44027015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. <b class=verse-num id=v44027016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship&#8217;s boat. <b class=verse-num id=v44027017-1>17&nbsp;</b>After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along. <b class=verse-num id=v44027018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo. <b class=verse-num id=v44027019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And on the third day they threw the ship&#8217;s tackle overboard with their own hands. <b class=verse-num id=v44027020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.</p><p id=p44027020_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44027021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, &#8220;Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. <b class=verse-num id=v44027022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. <b class=verse-num id=v44027023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, <b class=verse-num id=v44027024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and he said, &#8216;Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44027025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. <b class=verse-num id=v44027026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But we must run aground on some island.&#8221;</p><p id=p44027026_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44027027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. <b class=verse-num id=v44027028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. <b class=verse-num id=v44027029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. <b class=verse-num id=v44027030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship&#8217;s boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, <b class=verse-num id=v44027031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, &#8220;Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44027032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship&#8217;s boat and let it go.</p><p id=p44027032_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44027033-1>33&nbsp;</b>As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, &#8220;Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v44027034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44027035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. <b class=verse-num id=v44027036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v44027037-1>37&nbsp;</b>(We were in all 276 persons in the ship.) <b class=verse-num id=v44027038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</p><h3 id=p44027038_09-1>The Shipwreck</h3><p id=p44027038_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44027039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore. <b class=verse-num id=v44027040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. <b class=verse-num id=v44027041-1>41&nbsp;</b>But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. <b class=verse-num id=v44027042-1>42&nbsp;</b>The soldiers&#8217; plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape. <b class=verse-num id=v44027043-1>43&nbsp;</b>But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land, <b class=verse-num id=v44027044-1>44&nbsp;</b>and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.</p></div>

<h3 id=p27008001_01-1>Daniel&#8217;s Vision of the Ram and the Goat</h3><p id=p27008001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. <b class=verse-num id=v27008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the citadel, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal. <b class=verse-num id=v27008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. <b class=verse-num id=v27008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</p><p id=p27008004_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v27008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath. <b class=verse-num id=v27008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. <b class=verse-num id=v27008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.</p><p id=p27008008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. <b class=verse-num id=v27008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. <b class=verse-num id=v27008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. <b class=verse-num id=v27008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper. <b class=verse-num id=v27008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, &#8220;For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p27008014_09-1>The Interpretation of the Vision</h3><p id=p27008014_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. <b class=verse-num id=v27008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I heard a man&#8217;s voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, &#8220;Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, &#8220;Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.&#8221;</p><p id=p27008017_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up. <b class=verse-num id=v27008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end. <b class=verse-num id=v27008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. <b class=verse-num id=v27008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king. <b class=verse-num id=v27008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power. <b class=verse-num id=v27008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise. <b class=verse-num id=v27008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>His power shall be great&#8212;but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints. <b class=verse-num id=v27008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken&#8212;but by no human hand. <b class=verse-num id=v27008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.&#8221;</p><p id=p27008026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king&#8217;s business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.</p></div>

<h3 id=p27009001_01-1>Daniel&#8217;s Prayer for His People</h3><p id=p27009001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v27009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.</p><p id=p27009002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. <b class=verse-num id=v27009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, &#8220;O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, <b class=verse-num id=v27009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules. <b class=verse-num id=v27009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v27009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you. <b class=verse-num id=v27009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>To us, O LORD, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you. <b class=verse-num id=v27009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him <b class=verse-num id=v27009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v27009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. And the curse and oath that are written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him. <b class=verse-num id=v27009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v27009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the LORD our God, turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth. <b class=verse-num id=v27009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works that he has done, and we have not obeyed his voice. <b class=verse-num id=v27009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</p><p id=p27009015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;O Lord, according to all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy hill, because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all who are around us. <b class=verse-num id=v27009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate. <b class=verse-num id=v27009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy. <b class=verse-num id=v27009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p27009019_06-1>Gabriel Brings an Answer</h3><p id=p27009019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for the holy hill of my God, <b class=verse-num id=v27009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v27009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, &#8220;O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. <b class=verse-num id=v27009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.</p><h3 id=p27009023_10-1>The Seventy Weeks</h3><p id=p27009023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. <b class=verse-num id=v27009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. <b class=verse-num id=v27009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. <b class=verse-num id=v27009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p27010001_01-1>Daniel&#8217;s Terrifying Vision of a Man</h3><p id=p27010001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. And the word was true, and it was a great conflict. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.</p><p id=p27010001_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. <b class=verse-num id=v27010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. <b class=verse-num id=v27010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river (that is, the Tigris) <b class=verse-num id=v27010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. <b class=verse-num id=v27010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v27010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v27010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained no strength. <b class=verse-num id=v27010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep with my face to the ground.</p><p id=p27010009_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. <b class=verse-num id=v27010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;O Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent to you.&#8221; And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. <b class=verse-num id=v27010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and humbled yourself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words. <b class=verse-num id=v27010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days, but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia, <b class=verse-num id=v27010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come.&#8221;</p><p id=p27010014_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was mute. <b class=verse-num id=v27010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And behold, one in the likeness of the children of man touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, &#8220;O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. <b class=verse-num id=v27010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>How can my lord&#8217;s servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.&#8221;</p><p id=p27010017_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me. <b class=verse-num id=v27010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.&#8221; And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, &#8220;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. <b class=verse-num id=v27010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your prince.</p></div>

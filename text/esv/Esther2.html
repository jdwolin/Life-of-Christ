<h3 id=p17001001_01-1>The King&#8217;s Banquets</h3><p id=p17001001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces, <b class=verse-num id=v17001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa, the citadel, <b class=verse-num id=v17001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>in the third year of his reign he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him, <b class=verse-num id=v17001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness for many days, 180 days. <b class=verse-num id=v17001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of the garden of the king&#8217;s palace. <b class=verse-num id=v17001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. <b class=verse-num id=v17001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Drinks were served in golden vessels, vessels of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And drinking was according to this edict: &#8220;There is no compulsion.&#8221; For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired. <b class=verse-num id=v17001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus.</p><h3 id=p17001009_04-1>Queen Vashti&#8217;s Refusal</h3><p id=p17001009_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v17001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, <b class=verse-num id=v17001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty, for she was lovely to look at. <b class=verse-num id=v17001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king&#8217;s command delivered by the eunuchs. At this the king became enraged, and his anger burned within him.</p><p id=p17001012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v17001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for this was the king&#8217;s procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment, <b class=verse-num id=v17001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>the men next to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king&#8217;s face, and sat first in the kingdom): <b class=verse-num id=v17001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, &#8220;Not only against the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also against all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. <b class=verse-num id=v17001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the queen&#8217;s behavior will be made known to all women, causing them to look at their husbands with contempt, since they will say, &#8216;King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v17001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen&#8217;s behavior will say the same to all the king&#8217;s officials, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty. <b class=verse-num id=v17001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>If it please the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be repealed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. <b class=verse-num id=v17001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, for it is vast, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed. <b class=verse-num id=v17001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be master in his own household and speak according to the language of his people.</p></div>

Let their cosmetics be given them. <b class=verse-num id=v17002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.&#8221; This pleased the king, and he did so.</p><p id=p17002004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v17002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, <b class=verse-num id=v17002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away. <b class=verse-num id=v17002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter. <b class=verse-num id=v17002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So when the king&#8217;s order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king&#8217;s palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women. <b class=verse-num id=v17002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the young woman pleased him and won his favor. And he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king&#8217;s palace, and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem. <b class=verse-num id=v17002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known. <b class=verse-num id=v17002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.</p><p id=p17002011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v17002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v17002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king&#8217;s palace. <b class=verse-num id=v17002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king&#8217;s eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.</p><p id=p17002014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v17002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king&#8217;s eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her. <b class=verse-num id=v17002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign, <b class=verse-num id=v17002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. <b class=verse-num id=v17002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king gave a great feast for all his officials and servants; it was Esther&#8217;s feast. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.</p><h3 id=p17002018_04-1>Mordecai Discovers a Plot</h3><p id=p17002018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v17002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate. <b class=verse-num id=v17002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him. <b class=verse-num id=v17002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. <b class=verse-num id=v17002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai. <b class=verse-num id=v17002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.</p></div>

<h3 id=p17003001_01-1>Haman Plots Against the Jews</h3><p id=p17003001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v17003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And all the king&#8217;s servants who were at the king&#8217;s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage. <b class=verse-num id=v17003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the king&#8217;s servants who were at the king&#8217;s gate said to Mordecai, &#8220;Why do you transgress the king&#8217;s command?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai&#8217;s words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew. <b class=verse-num id=v17003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury. <b class=verse-num id=v17003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.</p><p id=p17003006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v17003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. <b class=verse-num id=v17003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, &#8220;There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king&#8217;s laws, so that it is not to the king&#8217;s profit to tolerate them. <b class=verse-num id=v17003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king&#8217;s business, that they may put it into the king&#8217;s treasuries.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the king said to Haman, &#8220;The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.&#8221;</p><p id=p17003011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v17003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the king&#8217;s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king&#8217;s satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king&#8217;s signet ring. <b class=verse-num id=v17003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Letters were sent by couriers to all the king&#8217;s provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. <b class=verse-num id=v17003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day. <b class=verse-num id=v17003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.</p></div>

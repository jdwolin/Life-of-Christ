<h3 id=p44009001_01-1>The Conversion of Saul</h3><p id=p44009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest <b class=verse-num id=v44009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him. <b class=verse-num id=v44009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Who are you, Lord?&#8221; And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. <b class=verse-num id=v44009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</p><p id=p44009009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, <span class=woc>&#8220;Ananias.&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;Here I am, Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Ananias answered, &#8220;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, &#8220;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized; <b class=verse-num id=v44009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and taking food, he was strengthened.</p><h3 id=p44009019_05-1>Saul Proclaims Jesus in Synagogues</h3><p id=p44009019_10-1>For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &#8220;He is the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And all who heard him were amazed and said, &#8220;Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.</p><h3 id=p44009022_10-1>Saul Escapes from Damascus</h3><p id=p44009022_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him, <b class=verse-num id=v44009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him, <b class=verse-num id=v44009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</p><h3 id=p44009025_14-1>Saul in Jerusalem</h3><p id=p44009025_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. <b class=verse-num id=v44009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him. <b class=verse-num id=v44009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</p><p id=p44009030_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.</p><h3 id=p44009031_17-1>The Healing of Aeneas</h3><p id=p44009031_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. <b class=verse-num id=v44009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed. <b class=verse-num id=v44009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to him, &#8220;Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.&#8221; And immediately he rose. <b class=verse-num id=v44009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</p><h3 id=p44009035_21-1>Dorcas Restored to Life</h3><p id=p44009035_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity. <b class=verse-num id=v44009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. <b class=verse-num id=v44009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, &#8220;Please come to us without delay.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. <b class=verse-num id=v44009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, &#8220;Tabitha, arise.&#8221; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. <b class=verse-num id=v44009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then, calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44009042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44009043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.</p></div>

What is the reason for your coming?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So he invited them in to be his guests.</p><p id=p44010023_06-1>The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <b class=verse-num id=v44010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Peter lifted him up, saying, &#8220;Stand up; I too am a man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered. <b class=verse-num id=v44010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v44010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.&#8221;</p><p id=p44010029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Cornelius said, &#8220;Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing <b class=verse-num id=v44010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8216;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. <b class=verse-num id=v44010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44010033_06-1>Gentiles Hear the Good News</h3><p id=p44010033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So Peter opened his mouth and said: &#8220;Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, <b class=verse-num id=v44010035-1>35&nbsp;</b>but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), <b class=verse-num id=v44010037-1>37&nbsp;</b>you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: <b class=verse-num id=v44010038-1>38&nbsp;</b>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, <b class=verse-num id=v44010040-1>40&nbsp;</b>but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, <b class=verse-num id=v44010041-1>41&nbsp;</b>not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44010042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44010043-1>43&nbsp;</b>To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44010043_11-1>The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles</h3><p id=p44010043_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010044-1>44&nbsp;</b>While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. <b class=verse-num id=v44010045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. <b class=verse-num id=v44010046-1>46&nbsp;</b>For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, <b class=verse-num id=v44010047-1>47&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44011001_01-1>Peter Reports to the Church</h3><p id=p44011001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v44011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Peter began and explained it to them in order: <b class=verse-num id=v44011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me. <b class=verse-num id=v44011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. <b class=verse-num id=v44011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I heard a voice saying to me, <span class=woc>&#8216;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But I said, &#8216;By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But the voice answered a second time from heaven, <span class=woc>&#8216;What God has made clean, do not call common.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v44011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. <b class=verse-num id=v44011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v44011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, &#8216;Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter; <b class=verse-num id=v44011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. <b class=verse-num id=v44011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, <span class=woc>&#8216;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God&#8217;s way?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, &#8220;Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44011018_06-1>The Church in Antioch</h3><p id=p44011018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. <b class=verse-num id=v44011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, <b class=verse-num id=v44011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, <b class=verse-num id=v44011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.

<h3 id=p42009001_01-1>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles</h3><p id=p42009001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v42009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, <b class=verse-num id=v42009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. <b class=verse-num id=v42009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</p><h3 id=p42009006_07-1>Herod Is Perplexed by Jesus</h3><p id=p42009006_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead, <b class=verse-num id=v42009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen. <b class=verse-num id=v42009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Herod said, &#8220;John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?&#8221; And he sought to see him.</p><h3 id=p42009009_12-1>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h3><p id=p42009009_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida. <b class=verse-num id=v42009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. <b class=verse-num id=v42009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, &#8220;Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;We have no more than five loaves and two fish&#8212;unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they did so, and had them all sit down. <b class=verse-num id=v42009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v42009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.</p><h3 id=p42009017_17-1>Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</h3><p id=p42009017_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Who do the crowds say that I am?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they answered, &#8220;John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221;</span> And Peter answered, &#8220;The Christ of God.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p42009020_23-1>Jesus Foretells His Death</h3><p id=p42009020_27-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one, <b class=verse-num id=v42009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42009022_27-1>Take Up Your Cross and Follow Jesus</h3><p id=p42009022_34-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he said to all, <span class=woc>&#8220;If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42009027_34-1>The Transfiguration</h3><p id=p42009027_36-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. <b class=verse-num id=v42009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. <b class=verse-num id=v42009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, <b class=verse-num id=v42009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v42009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. <b class=verse-num id=v42009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah&#8221;&#8212;not knowing what he said. <b class=verse-num id=v42009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. <b class=verse-num id=v42009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &#8220;This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</p><h3 id=p42009036_36-1>Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit</h3><p id=p42009036_44-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. <b class=verse-num id=v42009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, &#8220;Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. <b class=verse-num id=v42009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. <b class=verse-num id=v42009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009042-1>42&nbsp;</b>While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. <b class=verse-num id=v42009043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And all were astonished at the majesty of God.</p><h3 id=p42009043_44-1>Jesus Again Foretells His Death</h3><p id=p42009043_49-1>But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42009044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009045-1>45&nbsp;</b>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</p><h3 id=p42009045_49-1>Who Is the Greatest?</h3><p id=p42009045_53-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009046-1>46&nbsp;</b>An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. <b class=verse-num id=v42009047-1>47&nbsp;</b>But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side <b class=verse-num id=v42009048-1>48&nbsp;</b>and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42009048_53-1>Anyone Not Against Us Is For Us</h3><p id=p42009048_60-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009049-1>49&nbsp;</b>John answered, &#8220;Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009050-1>50&nbsp;</b>But Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42009050_60-1>A Samaritan Village Rejects Jesus</h3><p id=p42009050_65-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009051-1>51&nbsp;</b>When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v42009052-1>52&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him. <b class=verse-num id=v42009053-1>53&nbsp;</b>But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v42009054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &#8220;Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009055-1>55&nbsp;</b>But he turned and rebuked them. <b class=verse-num id=v42009056-1>56&nbsp;</b>And they went on to another village.</p><h3 id=p42009056_65-1>The Cost of Following Jesus</h3><p id=p42009056_70-1><b class=verse-num id=v42009057-1>57&nbsp;</b>As they were going along the road, someone said to him, &#8220;I will follow you wherever you go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009058-1>58&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009059-1>59&nbsp;</b>To another he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> But he said, &#8220;Lord, let me first go and bury my father.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009060-1>60&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42009061-1>61&nbsp;</b>Yet another said, &#8220;I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009062-1>62&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></p></div>

Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010003-1>3&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whatever house you enter, first say, &#8216;Peace be to this house!&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Heal the sick in it and say to them, &#8216;The kingdom of God has come near to you.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42010011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8216;Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you.

It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.</span></p><h3 id=p42011032_18-1>The Light in You</h3><p id=p42011032_22-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v42011033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42011036_22-1>Woes to the Pharisees and Lawyers</h3><p id=p42011036_28-1><b class=verse-num id=v42011037-1>37&nbsp;</b>While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table. <b class=verse-num id=v42011038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner. <b class=verse-num id=v42011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.</span></p><p id=p42011041_28-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v42011042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42011044_28-1><b class=verse-num id=v42011045-1>45&nbsp;</b>One of the lawyers answered him, &#8220;Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42011046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011048-1>48&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011049-1>49&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, &#8216;I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011050-1>50&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011051-1>51&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.

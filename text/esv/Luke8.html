When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, &#8220;Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. <b class=verse-num id=v42007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. <b class=verse-num id=v42007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, &#8216;Go,&#8217; and he goes; and to another, &#8216;Come,&#8217; and he comes; and to my servant, &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, <span class=woc>&#8220;I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.</p><h3 id=p42007010_06-1>Jesus Raises a Widow&#8217;s Son</h3><p id=p42007010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v42007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him. <b class=verse-num id=v42007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her. <b class=verse-num id=v42007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not weep.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Young man, I say to you, arise.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. <b class=verse-num id=v42007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, &#8220;A great prophet has arisen among us!&#8221; and &#8220;God has visited his people!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.</p><h3 id=p42007017_11-1>Messengers from John the Baptist</h3><p id=p42007017_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v42007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John, <b class=verse-num id=v42007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, &#8220;Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when the men had come to him, they said, &#8220;John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, &#8216;Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. <b class=verse-num id=v42007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42007023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42007023_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v42007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>When John&#8217;s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: <span class=woc>&#8220;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42007025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing?

And the twelve were with him, <b class=verse-num id=v42008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, <b class=verse-num id=v42008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod&#8217;s household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.</p><h3 id=p42008003_04-1>The Parable of the Sower</h3><p id=p42008003_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.&#8221;</span> As he said these things, he called out, <span class=woc>&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42008008_09-1>The Purpose of the Parables</h3><p id=p42008008_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v42008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, <b class=verse-num id=v42008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that &#8216;seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42008013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy.

For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. <b class=verse-num id=v42008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, &#8220;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) <b class=verse-num id=v42008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Jesus then asked him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;Legion,&#8221; for many demons had entered him. <b class=verse-num id=v42008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. <b class=verse-num id=v42008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these.

And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida. <b class=verse-num id=v42009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. <b class=verse-num id=v42009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, &#8220;Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;We have no more than five loaves and two fish&#8212;unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For there were about five thousand men.

<h3 id=p04012001_01-1>Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses</h3><p id=p04012001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v04012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman. <b class=verse-num id=v04012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?&#8221; And the LORD heard it. <b class=verse-num id=v04012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v04012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, &#8220;Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.&#8221; And the three of them came out. <b class=verse-num id=v04012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward. <b class=verse-num id=v04012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream. <b class=verse-num id=v04012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house. <b class=verse-num id=v04012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.</p><p id=p04012009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. <b class=verse-num id=v04012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned. <b class=verse-num id=v04012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Moses cried to the LORD, &#8220;O God, please heal her&#8212;please.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again. <b class=verse-num id=v04012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.</p></div>

From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; <b class=verse-num id=v04013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; <b class=verse-num id=v04013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; <b class=verse-num id=v04013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; <b class=verse-num id=v04013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; <b class=verse-num id=v04013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; <b class=verse-num id=v04013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; <b class=verse-num id=v04013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi; <b class=verse-num id=v04013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; <b class=verse-num id=v04013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; <b class=verse-num id=v04013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; <b class=verse-num id=v04013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. <b class=verse-num id=v04013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</p><p id=p04013016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, &#8220;Go up into the Negeb and go up into the hill country, <b class=verse-num id=v04013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many, <b class=verse-num id=v04013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds, <b class=verse-num id=v04013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land.&#8221; Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.</p><p id=p04013020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. <b class=verse-num id=v04013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>They went up into the Negeb and came to Hebron. Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) <b class=verse-num id=v04013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs. <b class=verse-num id=v04013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.</p><h3 id=p04013024_05-1>Report of the Spies</h3><p id=p04013024_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land. <b class=verse-num id=v04013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v04013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And they told him, &#8220;We came to the land to which you sent us. It flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. <b class=verse-num id=v04013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there. <b class=verse-num id=v04013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.&#8221;</p><p id=p04013029_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, &#8220;Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then the men who had gone up with him said, &#8220;We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04013032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, &#8220;The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people that we saw in it are of great height. <b class=verse-num id=v04013033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.&#8221;</p></div>

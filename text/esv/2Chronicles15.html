<h3 id=p14014001_01-1>Asa Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14014001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years. <b class=verse-num id=v14014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He took away the foreign altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and cut down the Asherim <b class=verse-num id=v14014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to keep the law and the commandment. <b class=verse-num id=v14014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him. <b class=verse-num id=v14014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for the LORD gave him peace. <b class=verse-num id=v14014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he said to Judah, &#8220;Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side.&#8221; So they built and prospered. <b class=verse-num id=v14014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, armed with large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin that carried shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.</p><p id=p14014008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. <b class=verse-num id=v14014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <b class=verse-num id=v14014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Asa cried to the LORD his God, &#8220;O LORD, there is none like you to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. <b class=verse-num id=v14014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive, for they were broken before the LORD and his army. The men of Judah carried away very much spoil. <b class=verse-num id=v14014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they attacked all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD was upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. <b class=verse-num id=v14014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they struck down the tents of those who had livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14015001_01-1>Asa&#8217;s Religious Reforms</h3><p id=p14015001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>The Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded, <b class=verse-num id=v14015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, &#8220;Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. <b class=verse-num id=v14015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law, <b class=verse-num id=v14015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them. <b class=verse-num id=v14015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. <b class=verse-num id=v14015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>They were broken in pieces. Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress. <b class=verse-num id=v14015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.&#8221;</p><p id=p14015007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>As soon as Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded, he took courage and put away the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. <b class=verse-num id=v14015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the spoil that they had brought 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v14015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul, <b class=verse-num id=v14015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>but that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman. <b class=verse-num id=v14015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They swore an oath to the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns. <b class=verse-num id=v14015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.</p><p id=p14015015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Even Maacah, his mother, King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made a detestable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron. <b class=verse-num id=v14015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true all his days. <b class=verse-num id=v14015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he brought into the house of God the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels. <b class=verse-num id=v14015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14016001_01-1>Asa&#8217;s Last Years</h3><p id=p14016001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14016001-1>16:1&nbsp;</b>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king&#8217;s house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. <b class=verse-num id=v14016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease. <b class=verse-num id=v14016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.</p><p id=p14016006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, &#8220;Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you. <b class=verse-num id=v14016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v14016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.</p><p id=p14016010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians. <b class=verse-num id=v14016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign. <b class=verse-num id=v14016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer&#8217;s art, and they made a very great fire in his honor.</p></div>

<h3 id=p26042001_01-1>The Temple&#8217;s Chambers</h3><p id=p26042001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26042001-1>42:1&nbsp;</b>Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers that were opposite the separate yard and opposite the building on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v26042002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The length of the building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits. <b class=verse-num id=v26042003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Facing the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. <b class=verse-num id=v26042004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, and their doors were on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v26042005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building. <b class=verse-num id=v26042006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones. <b class=verse-num id=v26042007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long. <b class=verse-num id=v26042008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the nave were a hundred cubits long. <b class=verse-num id=v26042009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.</p><p id=p26042009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26042010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers <b class=verse-num id=v26042011-1>11&nbsp;</b>with a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors, <b class=verse-num id=v26042012-1>12&nbsp;</b>as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.</p><p id=p26042012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26042013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings&#8212;the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering&#8212;for the place is holy. <b class=verse-num id=v26042014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.&#8221;</p><p id=p26042014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26042015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26042016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26042017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26042018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26042019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed. <b class=verse-num id=v26042020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 cubits long and 500 cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.</p></div>

And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory. <b class=verse-num id=v26043003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal.

And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places, <b class=verse-num id=v26043008-1>8&nbsp;</b>by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger. <b class=verse-num id=v26043009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.</p><p id=p26043009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26043010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan. <b class=verse-num id=v26043011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out. <b class=verse-num id=v26043012-1>12&nbsp;</b>This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy.

And this shall be the height of the altar: <b class=verse-num id=v26043014-1>14&nbsp;</b>from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; <b class=verse-num id=v26043015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns. <b class=verse-num id=v26043016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad. <b class=verse-num id=v26043017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit all around.

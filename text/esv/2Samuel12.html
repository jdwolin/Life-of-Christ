<h3 id=p10011001_01-1>David and Bathsheba</h3><p id=p10011001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</p><p id=p10011001_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king&#8217;s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. <b class=verse-num id=v10011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, &#8220;Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. <b class=verse-num id=v10011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, &#8220;I am pregnant.&#8221;</p><p id=p10011005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So David sent word to Joab, &#8220;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&#8221; And Joab sent Uriah to David. <b class=verse-num id=v10011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going. <b class=verse-num id=v10011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Uriah, &#8220;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&#8221; And Uriah went out of the king&#8217;s house, and there followed him a present from the king. <b class=verse-num id=v10011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&#8217;s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. <b class=verse-num id=v10011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When they told David, &#8220;Uriah did not go down to his house,&#8221; David said to Uriah, &#8220;Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Uriah said to David, &#8220;The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Uriah, &#8220;Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back.&#8221; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. <b class=verse-num id=v10011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</p><p id=p10011013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. <b class=verse-num id=v10011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In the letter he wrote, &#8220;Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men. <b class=verse-num id=v10011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died. <b class=verse-num id=v10011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting. <b class=verse-num id=v10011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he instructed the messenger, &#8220;When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king, <b class=verse-num id=v10011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>then, if the king&#8217;s anger rises, and if he says to you, &#8216;Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? <b class=verse-num id=v10011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?&#8217; then you shall say, &#8216;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p10011021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell. <b class=verse-num id=v10011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The messenger said to David, &#8220;The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v10011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king&#8217;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>David said to the messenger, &#8220;Thus shall you say to Joab, &#8216;Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.&#8217; And encourage him.&#8221;</p><p id=p10011025_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v10011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10012001_01-1>Nathan Rebukes David</h3><p id=p10012001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, &#8220;There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. <b class=verse-num id=v10012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <b class=verse-num id=v10012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him. <b class=verse-num id=v10012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man&#8217;s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then David&#8217;s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, &#8220;As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die, <b class=verse-num id=v10012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.&#8221;</p><p id=p10012006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Nathan said to David, &#8220;You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. <b class=verse-num id=v10012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And I gave you your master&#8217;s house and your master&#8217;s wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. <b class=verse-num id=v10012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v10012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. <b class=verse-num id=v10012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>David said to Nathan, &#8220;I have sinned against the LORD.&#8221; And Nathan said to David, &#8220;The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die. <b class=verse-num id=v10012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child who is born to you shall die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Nathan went to his house.</p><h3 id=p10012015_04-1>David&#8217;s Child Dies</h3><p id=p10012015_07-1>And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah&#8217;s wife bore to David, and he became sick. <b class=verse-num id=v10012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v10012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. <b class=verse-num id=v10012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, &#8220;Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, &#8220;Is the child dead?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. <b class=verse-num id=v10012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then his servants said to him, &#8220;What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, &#8216;Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10012023_07-1>Solomon&#8217;s Birth</h3><p id=p10012023_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him <b class=verse-num id=v10012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p><h3 id=p10012025_09-1>Rabbah Is Captured</h3><p id=p10012025_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city. <b class=verse-num id=v10012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, &#8220;I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. <b class=verse-num id=v10012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it. <b class=verse-num id=v10012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David&#8217;s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. <b class=verse-num id=v10012031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10013001_01-1>Amnon and Tamar</h3><p id=p10013001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom, David&#8217;s son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David&#8217;s son, loved her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man. <b class=verse-num id=v10013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?&#8221; Amnon said to him, &#8220;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jonadab said to him, &#8220;Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, &#8216;Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &#8220;Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p10013006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, &#8220;Go to your brother Amnon&#8217;s house and prepare food for him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#8217;s house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes. <b class=verse-num id=v10013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, &#8220;Send out everyone from me.&#8221; So everyone went out from him. <b class=verse-num id=v10013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Amnon said to Tamar, &#8220;Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.&#8221; And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <b class=verse-num id=v10013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &#8220;Come, lie with me, my sister.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>She answered him, &#8220;No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing. <b class=verse-num id=v10013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.</p><p id=p10013014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, &#8220;Get up! Go!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But she said to him, &#8220;No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.&#8221; But he would not listen to her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He called the young man who served him and said, &#8220;Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.</p><p id=p10013019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And her brother Absalom said to her, &#8220;Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart.&#8221; So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v10013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. <b class=verse-num id=v10013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.</p><h3 id=p10013022_04-1>Absalom Murders Amnon</h3><p id=p10013022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king&#8217;s sons. <b class=verse-num id=v10013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Absalom came to the king and said, &#8220;Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But the king said to Absalom, &#8220;No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.&#8221; He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing. <b class=verse-num id=v10013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, &#8220;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&#8221; And the king said to him, &#8220;Why should he go with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king&#8217;s sons go with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom commanded his servants, &#8220;Mark when Amnon&#8217;s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, &#8216;Strike Amnon,&#8217; then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&#8217;s sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.</p><p id=p10013029_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>While they were on the way, news came to David, &#8220;Absalom has struck down all the king&#8217;s sons, and not one of them is left.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v10013032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother, said, &#8220;Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king&#8217;s sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar. <b class=verse-num id=v10013033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king&#8217;s sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10013033_07-1>Absalom Flees to Geshur</h3><p id=p10013033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v10013035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Jonadab said to the king, &#8220;Behold, the king&#8217;s sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king&#8217;s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.</p><p id=p10013036_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day. <b class=verse-num id=v10013038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years. <b class=verse-num id=v10013039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.</p></div>

<p id=p62003001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v62003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. <b class=verse-num id=v62003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Beloved, we are God&#8217;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. <b class=verse-num id=v62003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.</p><p id=p62003003_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. <b class=verse-num id=v62003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. <b class=verse-num id=v62003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <b class=verse-num id=v62003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v62003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <b class=verse-num id=v62003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God&#8217;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. <b class=verse-num id=v62003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.</p><h3 id=p62003010_01-1>Love One Another</h3><p id=p62003010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. <b class=verse-num id=v62003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&#8217;s righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v62003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you. <b class=verse-num id=v62003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. <b class=verse-num id=v62003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</p><p id=p62003015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v62003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if anyone has the world&#8217;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&#8217;s love abide in him? <b class=verse-num id=v62003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</p><p id=p62003018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; <b class=verse-num id=v62003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. <b class=verse-num id=v62003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; <b class=verse-num id=v62003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. <b class=verse-num id=v62003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. <b class=verse-num id=v62003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.</p></div>

<h3 id=p62004001_01-1>Test the Spirits</h3><p id=p62004001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v62004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. <b class=verse-num id=v62004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, <b class=verse-num id=v62004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. <b class=verse-num id=v62004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. <b class=verse-num id=v62004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. <b class=verse-num id=v62004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</p><h3 id=p62004006_04-1>God Is Love</h3><p id=p62004006_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v62004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. <b class=verse-num id=v62004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. <b class=verse-num id=v62004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. <b class=verse-num id=v62004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. <b class=verse-num id=v62004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <b class=verse-num id=v62004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.</p><p id=p62004012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v62004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v62004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. <b class=verse-num id=v62004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. <b class=verse-num id=v62004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. <b class=verse-num id=v62004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. <b class=verse-num id=v62004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. <b class=verse-num id=v62004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>We love because he first loved us. <b class=verse-num id=v62004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>If anyone says, &#8220;I love God,&#8221; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. <b class=verse-num id=v62004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.</p></div>

And his commandments are not burdensome. <b class=verse-num id=v62005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world&#8212;our faith. <b class=verse-num id=v62005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p><h3 id=p62005005_04-1>Testimony Concerning the Son of God</h3><p id=p62005005_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v62005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>This is he who came by water and blood&#8212;Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v62005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For there are three that testify: <b class=verse-num id=v62005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. <b class=verse-num id=v62005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. <b class=verse-num id=v62005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. <b class=verse-num id=v62005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. <b class=verse-num id=v62005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p><h3 id=p62005012_10-1>That You May Know</h3><p id=p62005012_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v62005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life. <b class=verse-num id=v62005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. <b class=verse-num id=v62005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.</p><p id=p62005015_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v62005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life&#8212;to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. <b class=verse-num id=v62005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.</p><p id=p62005017_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v62005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.</p><p id=p62005018_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v62005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.</p><p id=p62005019_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v62005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

<h3 id=p02001001_01-1>Israel Increases Greatly in Egypt</h3><p id=p02001001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v02001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household: <b class=verse-num id=v02001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, <b class=verse-num id=v02001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, <b class=verse-num id=v02001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. <b class=verse-num id=v02001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation. <b class=verse-num id=v02001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.</p><h3 id=p02001007_06-1>Pharaoh Oppresses Israel</h3><p id=p02001007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v02001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to his people, &#8220;Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us. <b class=verse-num id=v02001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses. <b class=verse-num id=v02001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v02001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves <b class=verse-num id=v02001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.</p><p id=p02001014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, <b class=verse-num id=v02001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live. <b class=verse-num id=v02001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, &#8220;Why have you done this, and let the male children live?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The midwives said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong. <b class=verse-num id=v02001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. <b class=verse-num id=v02001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, &#8220;Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.&#8221;</p></div>

She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank. <b class=verse-num id=v02002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him. <b class=verse-num id=v02002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it. <b class=verse-num id=v02002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, &#8220;This is one of the Hebrews&#8217; children.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then his sister said to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, &#8220;Go.&#8221; So the girl went and called the child&#8217;s mother. <b class=verse-num id=v02002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, &#8220;Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.&#8221; So the woman took the child and nursed him. <b class=verse-num id=v02002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, &#8220;Because,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I drew him out of the water.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02002010_05-1>Moses Flees to Midian</h3><p id=p02002010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people. <b class=verse-num id=v02002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. <b class=verse-num id=v02002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, &#8220;Why do you strike your companion?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&#8221; Then Moses was afraid, and thought, &#8220;Surely the thing is known.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.</p><p id=p02002015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father&#8217;s flock. <b class=verse-num id=v02002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock. <b class=verse-num id=v02002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, &#8220;How is it that you have come home so soon today?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He said to his daughters, &#8220;Then where is he?

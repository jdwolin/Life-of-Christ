This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44001011_09-1>Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</h3><p id=p44001011_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&#8217;s journey away. <b class=verse-num id=v44001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. <b class=verse-num id=v44001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p><p id=p44001014_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said, <b class=verse-num id=v44001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>(Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. <b class=verse-num id=v44001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <b class=verse-num id=v44001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For it is written in the Book of Psalms,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44001020_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;May his camp become desolate,</span><br /><span id=p44001020_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let there be no one to dwell in it&#8217;;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44001020_14-1 class=same-paragraph>and</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44001020_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Let another take his office.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44001020_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <b class=verse-num id=v44001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us&#8212;one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias. <b class=verse-num id=v44001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they prayed and said, &#8220;You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen <b class=verse-num id=v44001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p></div>

together in one place. <b class=verse-num id=v44002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. <b class=verse-num id=v44002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p><p id=p44002004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v44002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. <b class=verse-num id=v44002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they were amazed and astonished, saying, &#8220;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? <b class=verse-num

id=v44002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. <b class=verse-num

class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44002028_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v44002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, <b class=verse-num id=v44002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. <b class=verse-num id=v44002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. <b class=verse-num id=v44002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. <b class=verse-num id=v44002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44002034_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</span><br /><span id=p44002034_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sit at my right hand,</span><br /><span id=p44002035_11-1 class=indent line><b class=verse-num inline

class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.&#8221;</p><p id=p44002036_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to them, &#8220;Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v44002039-1>39&nbsp;</b>For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, &#8220;Save yourselves from this crooked generation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44002041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p><h3 id=p44002041_11-1>The Fellowship of the Believers</h3><p id=p44002041_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v44002042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And they devoted themselves to the apostles&#8217; teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. <b class=verse-num id=v44002043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. <b class=verse-num id=v44002044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And all who believed were together and had all things in common. <b class=verse-num id=v44002045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. <b class=verse-num id=v44002046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, <b class=verse-num id=v44002047-1>47&nbsp;</b>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</p></div>

So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, <b class=verse-num id=v01027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &#8220;I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, <b class=verse-num id=v01027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. <b class=verse-num id=v01027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. <b class=verse-num id=v01027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8220;Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <b class=verse-num id=v01027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027013-1>13&nbsp;</b>His mother said to him, &#8220;Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01027013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved. <b class=verse-num id=v01027015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. <b class=verse-num id=v01027016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. <b class=verse-num id=v01027017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p><p id=p01027017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So he went in to his father and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am. Who are you, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to his father, &#8220;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But Isaac said to his son, &#8220;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Because the LORD your God granted me success.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac said to Jacob, &#8220;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, &#8220;The voice is Jacob&#8217;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&#8217;s hands. So he blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01027024-1>24&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Are you really my son Esau?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son&#8217;s game and bless you.&#8221; So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</p><p id=p01027025_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then his father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Come near and kiss me, my son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p01027027_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;See, the smell of my son</span><br /><span id=p01027027_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed!</span><br /><span id=p01027028_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v01027028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;May God give you of the dew of heaven</span><br /><span id=p01027028_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of the fatness of the earth</span><br /><span id=p01027028_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and plenty of grain and wine.</span><br /><span id=p01027029_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v01027029-1>29&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let peoples serve you,</span><br /><span id=p01027029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nations bow down to you.</span><br /><span id=p01027029_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be lord over your brothers,</span><br /><span id=p01027029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may your mother&#8217;s sons bow down to you.</span><br /><span id=p01027029_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed be everyone who curses you,</span><br /><span id=p01027029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and blessed be everyone who blesses you!&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p01027029_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027030-1>30&nbsp;</b>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. <b class=verse-num id=v01027031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, &#8220;Let my father arise and eat of his son&#8217;s game, that you may bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027032-1>32&nbsp;</b>His father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, &#8220;Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, &#8220;Bless me, even me also, O my father!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Esau said, &#8220;Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Have you not reserved a blessing for me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Isaac answered and said to Esau, &#8220;Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Esau said to his father, &#8220;Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.&#8221; And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</p><p id=p01027038_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p01027039_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be,</span><br /><span id=p01027039_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and away from the dew of heaven on high.</span><br /><span id=p01027040_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v01027040-1>40&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;By your sword you shall live,</span><br /><span id=p01027040_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you shall serve your brother;</span><br /><span id=p01027040_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;but when you grow restless</span><br /><span id=p01027040_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall break his yoke from your neck.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p01027040_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, &#8220;The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01027042-1>42&nbsp;</b>But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, &#8220;Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. <b class=verse-num id=v01027043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran <b class=verse-num id=v01027044-1>44&nbsp;</b>and stay with him a while, until your brother&#8217;s fury turns away&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v01027045-1>45&nbsp;</b>until your brother&#8217;s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?&#8221;</p><p id=p01027045_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01027046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, &#8220;I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?&#8221;</p></div>

Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. <b class=verse-num id=v01028012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven.

The stone on the well&#8217;s mouth was large, <b class=verse-num id=v01029003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.</p><p id=p01029003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to them, &#8220;My brothers, where do you come from?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We are from Haran.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We know him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Is it well with him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But they said, &#8220;We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.&#8221;</p><p id=p01029008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029009-1>9&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&#8217;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. <b class=verse-num id=v01029010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01029011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <b class=verse-num id=v01029012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#8217;s kinsman, and that he was Rebekah&#8217;s son, and she ran and told her father.</p><p id=p01029012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister&#8217;s son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things, <b class=verse-num id=v01029014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and Laban said to him, &#8220;Surely you are my bone and my flesh!&#8221; And he stayed with him a month.</p><p id=p01029014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. <b class=verse-num id=v01029017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Leah&#8217;s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v01029018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Jacob loved Rachel.

Why then have you deceived me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Laban said, &#8220;It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. <b class=verse-num id=v01029027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01029029-1>29&nbsp;</b>(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.) <b class=verse-num id=v01029030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.</p><h3 id=p01029030_06-1>Jacob&#8217;s Children</h3><p id=p01029030_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. <b class=verse-num id=v01029032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, &#8220;Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029033-1>33&nbsp;</b>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also.&#8221; And she called his name Simeon. <b class=verse-num id=v01029034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&#8221; Therefore his name was called Levi. <b class=verse-num id=v01029035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;This time I will praise the LORD.&#8221; Therefore she called his name Judah.

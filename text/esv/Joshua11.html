<h3 id=p06010001_01-1>The Sun Stands Still</h3><p id=p06010001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, <b class=verse-num id=v06010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors. <b class=verse-num id=v06010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v06010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.</p><p id=p06010005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, &#8220;Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. <b class=verse-num id=v06010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal. <b class=verse-num id=v06010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.</p><p id=p06010011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>At that time Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p06010012_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sun, stand still at Gibeon,</span><br /><span id=p06010012_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p06010013_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v06010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,</span><br /><span id=p06010013_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p06010013_05-1 class=same-paragraph>Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day. <b class=verse-num id=v06010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for the LORD fought for Israel.</p><p id=p06010014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</p><h3 id=p06010015_05-1>Five Amorite Kings Executed</h3><p id=p06010015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And it was told to Joshua, &#8220;The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, &#8220;Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them, <b class=verse-num id=v06010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, <b class=verse-num id=v06010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.</p><p id=p06010021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said, &#8220;Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. <b class=verse-num id=v06010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, &#8220;Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings.&#8221; Then they came near and put their feet on their necks. <b class=verse-num id=v06010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening. <b class=verse-num id=v06010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</p><p id=p06010027_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>As for Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p><h3 id=p06010028_09-1>Conquest of Southern Canaan</h3><p id=p06010028_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p><p id=p06010030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it. <b class=verse-num id=v06010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.</p><p id=p06010032_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.</p><p id=p06010033_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it. <b class=verse-num id=v06010035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.</p><p id=p06010035_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it <b class=verse-num id=v06010037-1>37&nbsp;</b>and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.</p><p id=p06010037_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it <b class=verse-num id=v06010039-1>39&nbsp;</b>and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.</p><p id=p06010039_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So Joshua struck the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but devoted to destruction all that breathed, just as the LORD God of Israel commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v06010041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v06010042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06010043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</p></div>

You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Joshua and all his warriors came suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v06011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining. <b class=verse-num id=v06011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joshua did to them just as the LORD said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.</p><p id=p06011009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms. <b class=verse-num id=v06011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction; there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v06011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v06011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; that Joshua burned. <b class=verse-num id=v06011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every person they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed. <b class=verse-num id=v06011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.</p><p id=p06011015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland <b class=verse-num id=v06011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death. <b class=verse-num id=v06011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. <b class=verse-num id=v06011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle. <b class=verse-num id=v06011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For it was the LORD&#8217;s doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, just as the LORD commanded Moses.</p><p id=p06011020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities. <b class=verse-num id=v06011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod did some remain. <b class=verse-num id=v06011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses.

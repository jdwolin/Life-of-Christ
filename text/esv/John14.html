<h3 id=p43013001_01-1>Jesus Washes the Disciples&#8217; Feet</h3><p id=p43013001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. <b class=verse-num id=v43013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s son, to betray him, <b class=verse-num id=v43013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, <b class=verse-num id=v43013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. <b class=verse-num id=v43013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <b class=verse-num id=v43013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &#8220;Lord, do you wash my feet?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Peter said to him, &#8220;You shall never wash my feet.&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Not all of you are clean.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43013011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you understand what I have done to you?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, &#8216;He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43013020_06-1>One of You Will Betray Me</h3><p id=p43013020_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. <b class=verse-num id=v43013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus&#8217; side, <b class=verse-num id=v43013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. <b class=verse-num id=v43013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, &#8220;Lord, who is it?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.&#8221;</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <b class=verse-num id=v43013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What you are going to do, do quickly.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#8220;Buy what we need for the feast,&#8221; or that he should give something to the poor. <b class=verse-num id=v43013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p><h3 id=p43013030_12-1>A New Commandment</h3><p id=p43013030_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, &#8216;Where I am going you cannot come.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43013035_15-1>Jesus Foretells Peter&#8217;s Denial</h3><p id=p43013035_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, where are you going?&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</span></p></div>

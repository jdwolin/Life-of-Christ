He was a chief tax collector and was rich. <b class=verse-num id=v42019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. <b class=verse-num id=v42019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. <b class=verse-num id=v42019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. <b class=verse-num id=v42019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they saw it, they all grumbled, &#8220;He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#8220;Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42019010_04-1>The Parable of the Ten Minas</h3><p id=p42019010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. <b class=verse-num id=v42019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said therefore, <span class=woc>&#8220;A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, &#8216;Engage in business until I come.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, &#8216;We do not want this man to reign over us.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The first came before him, saying, &#8216;Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said to him, &#8216;Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the second came, saying, &#8216;Lord, your mina has made five minas.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said to him, &#8216;And you are to be over five cities.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then another came, saying, &#8216;Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He said to him, &#8216;I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said to those who stood by, &#8216;Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And they said to him, &#8216;Lord, he has ten minas!&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8216;I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42019027_10-1>The Triumphal Entry</h3><p id=p42019027_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v42019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, <b class=verse-num id=v42019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If anyone asks you, &#8216;Why are you untying it?&#8217; you shall say this: &#8216;The Lord has need of it.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. <b class=verse-num id=v42019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, &#8220;Why are you untying the colt?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;The Lord has need of it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. <b class=verse-num id=v42019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. <b class=verse-num id=v42019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>As he was drawing near&#8212;already on the way down the Mount of Olives&#8212;the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, <b class=verse-num id=v42019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, &#8220;Teacher, rebuke your disciples.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42019040_13-1>Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem</h3><p id=p42019040_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, <b class=verse-num id=v42019042-1>42&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42019044_17-1>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3><p id=p42019044_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold, <b class=verse-num id=v42019046-1>46&nbsp;</b>saying to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is written, &#8216;My house shall be a house of prayer,&#8217; but you have made it a den of robbers.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42019046_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And he was teaching daily in the temple.

Now tell me,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And they discussed it with one another, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; he will say, &#8216;Why did you not believe him?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v42020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if we say, &#8216;From man,&#8217; all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they answered that they did not know where it came from. <b class=verse-num id=v42020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42020008_06-1>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants</h3><p id=p42020008_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v42020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he began to tell the people this parable: <span class=woc>&#8220;A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then the owner of the vineyard said, &#8216;What shall I do?

What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.&#8221;</span> When they heard this, they said, &#8220;Surely not!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he looked directly at them and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;What then is this that is written:</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p42020017_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;The stone that the builders rejected</span><br /><span id=p42020017_12-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become the cornerstone&#8217;?</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></p><p id=p42020017_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num woc id=v42020018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42020018_12-1>Paying Taxes to Caesar</h3><p id=p42020018_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v42020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people. <b class=verse-num id=v42020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. <b class=verse-num id=v42020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So they asked him, &#8220;Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. <b class=verse-num id=v42020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42020024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Show me a denarius.

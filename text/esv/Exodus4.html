He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. <b class=verse-num id=v02003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Moses said, &#8220;I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, &#8220;Moses, Moses!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8221; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</p><p id=p02003006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, <b class=verse-num id=v02003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <b class=verse-num id=v02003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. <b class=verse-num id=v02003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Moses said to God, &#8220;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&#8221;</p><p id=p02003012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Moses said to God, &#8220;If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, &#8216;The God of your fathers has sent me to you,&#8217; and they ask me, &#8216;What is his name?&#8217; what shall I say to them?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>God said to Moses, &#8220;I AM WHO I AM.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Say this to the people of Israel: &#8216;I AM has sent me to you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>God also said to Moses, &#8220;Say this to the people of Israel: &#8216;The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.&#8217; This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations. <b class=verse-num id=v02003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, &#8216;The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, &#8220;I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v02003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, &#8216;The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand. <b class=verse-num id=v02003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go. <b class=verse-num id=v02003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty, <b class=verse-num id=v02003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.&#8221;</p></div>

I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. <b class=verse-num id=v02004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do. <b class=verse-num id=v02004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him. <b class=verse-num id=v02004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02004017_05-1>Moses Returns to Egypt</h3><p id=p02004017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, &#8220;Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.&#8221; And Jethro said to Moses, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, &#8220;Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt.

I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then they said, &#8220;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the king of Egypt said to them, &#8220;Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work?

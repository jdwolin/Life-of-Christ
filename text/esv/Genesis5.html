<h3 id=p01004001_01-1>Cain and Abel</h3><p id=p01004001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, &#8220;I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, <b class=verse-num id=v01004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, <b class=verse-num id=v01004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell. <b class=verse-num id=v01004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Cain, &#8220;Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen? <b class=verse-num id=v01004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it.&#8221;</p><p id=p01004007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Cain, &#8220;Where is Abel your brother?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know; am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said, &#8220;What have you done? The voice of your brother&#8217;s blood is crying to me from the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&#8217;s blood from your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v01004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Cain said to the LORD, &#8220;My punishment is greater than I can bear. <b class=verse-num id=v01004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Behold, you have driven me today away from the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to him, &#8220;Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.&#8221; And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him. <b class=verse-num id=v01004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</p><p id=p01004016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. <b class=verse-num id=v01004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. <b class=verse-num id=v01004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <b class=verse-num id=v01004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. <b class=verse-num id=v01004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>His brother&#8217;s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. <b class=verse-num id=v01004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</p><p id=p01004022_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Lamech said to his wives:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p01004023_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;</span><br /><span id=p01004023_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say:</span><br /><span id=p01004023_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have killed a man for wounding me,</span><br /><span id=p01004023_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a young man for striking me.</span><br /><span id=p01004024_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v01004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If Cain&#8217;s revenge is sevenfold,</span><br /><span id=p01004024_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Lamech&#8217;s is seventy-sevenfold.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p01004024_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, &#8220;God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD.</p></div>

Prophesy against the land of Israel <b class=verse-num id=v26021003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked. <b class=verse-num id=v26021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north. <b class=verse-num id=v26021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn my sword from its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again.</p><p id=p26021005_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan before their eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v26021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they say to you, &#8216;Why do you groan?&#8217; you shall say, &#8216;Because of the news that it is coming. Every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming, and it will be fulfilled,&#8217;&#8221; declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26021007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, say:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p26021009_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;A sword, a sword is sharpened</span><br /><span id=p26021009_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and also polished,</span><br /><span id=p26021010_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v26021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;sharpened for slaughter,</span><br /><span id=p26021010_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polished to flash like lightning!</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p26021010_07-1 class=same-paragraph>(Or shall we rejoice?

It is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer. <b class=verse-num id=v26021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Strike therefore upon your thigh. <b class=verse-num id=v26021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For it will not be a testing&#8212;what could it do if you despise the rod?&#8221; declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26021013_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, prophesy. Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yes, three times, the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them, <b class=verse-num id=v26021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; it is taken up for slaughter. <b class=verse-num id=v26021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed. <b class=verse-num id=v26021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken.&#8221;</p><p id=p26021017_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me again: <b class=verse-num id=v26021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to a city. <b class=verse-num id=v26021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified. <b class=verse-num id=v26021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults the teraphim; he looks at the liver. <b class=verse-num id=v26021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers. <b class=verse-num id=v26021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But to them it will seem like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken.</p><p id=p26021023_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear&#8212;because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand. <b class=verse-num id=v26021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And you, O profane wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment, <b class=verse-num id=v26021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted. <b class=verse-num id=v26021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.</p><p id=p26021027_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter. It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v26021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you&#8212;to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment. <b class=verse-num id=v26021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. <b class=verse-num id=v26021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy. <b class=verse-num id=v26021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be no more remembered, for I the LORD have spoken.&#8221;</p></div>

With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me. <b class=verse-num id=v26023038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths. <b class=verse-num id=v26023039-1>39&nbsp;</b>For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, this is what they did in my house. <b class=verse-num id=v26023040-1>40&nbsp;</b>They even sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments. <b class=verse-num id=v26023041-1>41&nbsp;</b>You sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil. <b class=verse-num id=v26023042-1>42&nbsp;</b>The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort, drunkards were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands of the women, and beautiful crowns on their heads.</p><p id=p26023042_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26023043-1>43&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, &#8216;Now they will continue to use her for a whore, even her!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26023044-1>44&nbsp;</b>For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women! <b class=verse-num id=v26023045-1>45&nbsp;</b>But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.&#8221;</p><p id=p26023045_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26023046-1>46&nbsp;</b>For thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Bring up a vast host against them, and make them an object of terror and a plunder. <b class=verse-num id=v26023047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And the host shall stone them and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses. <b class=verse-num id=v26023048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done. <b class=verse-num id=v26023049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And they shall return your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry, and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p></div>

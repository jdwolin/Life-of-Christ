<h3 id=p02016001_01-1>Bread from Heaven</h3><p id=p02016001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v02016001-1>16:1&nbsp;</b>They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness, <b class=verse-num id=v02016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and the people of Israel said to them, &#8220;Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.&#8221;</p><p id=p02016003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day&#8217;s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. <b class=verse-num id=v02016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, &#8220;At evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v02016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against the LORD. For what are we, that you grumble against us?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Moses said, &#8220;When the LORD gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him&#8212;what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p02016008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, &#8216;Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. <b class=verse-num id=v02016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, <b class=verse-num id=v02016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, &#8216;At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p02016012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v02016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v02016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, &#8220;What is it?&#8221; For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, &#8220;It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat. <b class=verse-num id=v02016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>This is what the LORD has commanded: &#8216;Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. <b class=verse-num id=v02016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat. <b class=verse-num id=v02016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to them, &#8220;Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. <b class=verse-num id=v02016021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.</p><p id=p02016021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016022-1>22&nbsp;</b>On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, <b class=verse-num id=v02016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>he said to them, &#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded: &#8216;Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. <b class=verse-num id=v02016025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field. <b class=verse-num id=v02016026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.&#8221;</p><p id=p02016026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. <b class=verse-num id=v02016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? <b class=verse-num id=v02016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So the people rested on the seventh day.</p><p id=p02016030_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. <b class=verse-num id=v02016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded: &#8216;Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. <b class=verse-num id=v02016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. <b class=verse-num id=v02016036-1>36&nbsp;</b>(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)</p></div>

Why do you test the LORD?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, &#8220;Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Moses cried to the LORD, &#8220;What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. <b class=verse-num id=v02017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.&#8221; And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v02017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, &#8220;Is the LORD among us or not?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02017007_05-1>Israel Defeats Amalek</h3><p id=p02017007_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v02017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. <b class=verse-num id=v02017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Moses said to Joshua, &#8220;Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. <b class=verse-num id=v02017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed. <b class=verse-num id=v02017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Moses&#8217; hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side.

The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, &#8220;I have been a sojourner in a foreign land&#8221;), <b class=verse-num id=v02018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, &#8220;The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh&#8221;). <b class=verse-num id=v02018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God. <b class=verse-num id=v02018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when he sent word to Moses, &#8220;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent. <b class=verse-num id=v02018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&#8217;s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them. <b class=verse-num id=v02018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p><p id=p02018009_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jethro said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v02018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses&#8217; father-in-law before God.</p><p id=p02018012_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening. <b class=verse-num id=v02018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Moses&#8217; father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, &#8220;What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to his father-in-law, &#8220;Because the people come to me to inquire of God; <b class=verse-num id=v02018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Moses&#8217; father-in-law said to him, &#8220;What you are doing is not good. <b class=verse-num id=v02018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone. <b class=verse-num id=v02018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall represent the people before God and bring their cases to God, <b class=verse-num id=v02018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do. <b class=verse-num id=v02018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Moreover, look for able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. <b class=verse-num id=v02018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And let them judge the people at all times. Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. <b class=verse-num id=v02018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.&#8221;</p><p id=p02018023_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v02018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. <b class=verse-num id=v02018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. <b class=verse-num id=v02018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v02018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went away to his own country.</p></div>

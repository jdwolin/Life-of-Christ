It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them, <b class=verse-num id=v26021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; it is taken up for slaughter. <b class=verse-num id=v26021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed. <b class=verse-num id=v26021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken.&#8221;</p><p id=p26021017_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me again: <b class=verse-num id=v26021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to a city. <b class=verse-num id=v26021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified. <b class=verse-num id=v26021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults the teraphim; he looks at the liver. <b class=verse-num id=v26021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers. <b class=verse-num id=v26021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But to them it will seem like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken.</p><p id=p26021023_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear&#8212;because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand. <b class=verse-num id=v26021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And you, O profane wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment, <b class=verse-num id=v26021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted. <b class=verse-num id=v26021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.</p><p id=p26021027_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter. It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v26021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you&#8212;to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment. <b class=verse-num id=v26021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. <b class=verse-num id=v26021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy. <b class=verse-num id=v26021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be no more remembered, for I the LORD have spoken.&#8221;</p></div>

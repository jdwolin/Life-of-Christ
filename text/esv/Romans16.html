For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. <b class=verse-num id=v45015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you. <b class=verse-num id=v45015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</p><p id=p45015029_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v45015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf, <b class=verse-num id=v45015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, <b class=verse-num id=v45015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>so that by God&#8217;s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. <b class=verse-num id=v45015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>May the God of peace be with you all.

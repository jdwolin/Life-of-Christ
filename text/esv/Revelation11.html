<h3 id=p66010001_01-1>The Angel and the Little Scroll</h3><p id=p66010001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v66010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire. <b class=verse-num id=v66010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, <b class=verse-num id=v66010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he called out, the seven thunders sounded. <b class=verse-num id=v66010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, &#8220;Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v66010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven <b class=verse-num id=v66010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay, <b class=verse-num id=v66010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.</p><p id=p66010007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v66010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, &#8220;Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v66010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, &#8220;Take and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v66010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter. <b class=verse-num id=v66010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And I was told, &#8220;You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.&#8221;</p></div>

If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed. <b class=verse-num id=v66011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire. <b class=verse-num id=v66011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, <b class=verse-num id=v66011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. <b class=verse-num id=v66011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, <b class=verse-num id=v66011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v66011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. <b class=verse-num id=v66011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &#8220;Come up here!&#8221; And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. <b class=verse-num id=v66011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell.

And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it. <b class=verse-num id=v66012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>She gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, <b class=verse-num id=v66012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for 1,260 days.</p><h3 id=p66012006_06-1>Satan Thrown Down to Earth</h3><p id=p66012006_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v66012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon.

Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v02007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them. <b class=verse-num id=v02007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</p><p id=p02007007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v02007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, <b class=verse-num id=v02007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When Pharaoh says to you, &#8216;Prove yourselves by working a miracle,&#8217; then you shall say to Aaron, &#8216;Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent. <b class=verse-num id=v02007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts. <b class=verse-num id=v02007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron&#8217;s staff swallowed up their staffs. <b class=verse-num id=v02007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Still Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.</p><h3 id=p02007013_06-1>The First Plague: Water Turned to Blood</h3><p id=p02007013_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go. <b class=verse-num id=v02007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent. <b class=verse-num id=v02007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And you shall say to him, &#8216;The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness.&#8221; But so far, you have not obeyed. <b class=verse-num id=v02007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD, &#8220;By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood. <b class=verse-num id=v02007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p02007019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood. <b class=verse-num id=v02007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So Pharaoh&#8217;s heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said. <b class=verse-num id=v02007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart. <b class=verse-num id=v02007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.</p><p id=p02007024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.</p></div>

They shall be left only in the Nile.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v02008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields. <b class=verse-num id=v02008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. <b class=verse-num id=v02008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.</p><h3 id=p02008015_05-1>The Third Plague: Gnats</h3><p id=p02008015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast. <b class=verse-num id=v02008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, &#8220;This is the finger of God.&#8221; But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.</p><h3 id=p02008019_09-1>The Fourth Plague: Flies</h3><p id=p02008019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand. <b class=verse-num id=v02008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants&#8217; houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.</p><p id=p02008024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, &#8220;Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Moses said, &#8220;It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? <b class=verse-num id=v02008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>We must go three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he tells us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Pharaoh said, &#8220;I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Moses said, &#8220;Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained. <b class=verse-num id=v02008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.</p></div>

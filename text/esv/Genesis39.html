<h3 id=p01038001_01-1>Judah and Tamar</h3><p id=p01038001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01038001-1>38:1&nbsp;</b>It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <b class=verse-num id=v01038002-1>2&nbsp;</b>There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her and went in to her, <b class=verse-num id=v01038003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. <b class=verse-num id=v01038004-1>4&nbsp;</b>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. <b class=verse-num id=v01038005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. Judah was in Chezib when she bore him.</p><p id=p01038005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <b class=verse-num id=v01038007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But Er, Judah&#8217;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death. <b class=verse-num id=v01038008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to Onan, &#8220;Go in to your brother&#8217;s wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother&#8217;s wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01038010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also. <b class=verse-num id=v01038011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, &#8220;Remain a widow in your father&#8217;s house, till Shelah my son grows up&#8221;&#8212;for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained in her father&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p01038011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038012-1>12&nbsp;</b>In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua&#8217;s daughter, died. When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. <b class=verse-num id=v01038013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when Tamar was told, &#8220;Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038014-1>14&nbsp;</b>she took off her widow&#8217;s garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage. <b class=verse-num id=v01038015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <b class=verse-num id=v01038016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He turned to her at the roadside and said, &#8220;Come, let me come in to you,&#8221; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, &#8220;What will you give me, that you may come in to me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He answered, &#8220;I will send you a young goat from the flock.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;If you give me a pledge, until you send it&#8212;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;What pledge shall I give you?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.&#8221; So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him. <b class=verse-num id=v01038019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.</p><p id=p01038019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman&#8217;s hand, he did not find her. <b class=verse-num id=v01038021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he asked the men of the place, &#8220;Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enaim at the roadside?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No cult prostitute has been here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So he returned to Judah and said, &#8220;I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, &#8216;No cult prostitute has been here.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Judah replied, &#8220;Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her.&#8221;</p><p id=p01038023_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038024-1>24&nbsp;</b>About three months later Judah was told, &#8220;Tamar your daughter-in-law has been immoral. Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.&#8221; And Judah said, &#8220;Bring her out, and let her be burned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038025-1>25&nbsp;</b>As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, &#8220;By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Please identify whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Judah identified them and said, &#8220;She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.&#8221; And he did not know her again.</p><p id=p01038026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01038027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb. <b class=verse-num id=v01038028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, &#8220;This one came out first.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01038029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, &#8220;What a breach you have made for yourself!&#8221; Therefore his name was called Perez. <b class=verse-num id=v01038030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.</p></div>

How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01039010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.</p><p id=p01039010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01039011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house, <b class=verse-num id=v01039012-1>12&nbsp;</b>she caught him by his garment, saying, &#8220;Lie with me.&#8221; But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house. <b class=verse-num id=v01039013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house, <b class=verse-num id=v01039014-1>14&nbsp;</b>she called to the men of her household and said to them, &#8220;See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us.

<h3 id=p01040001_01-1>Joseph Interprets Two Prisoners&#8217; Dreams</h3><p id=p01040001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01040001-1>40:1&nbsp;</b>Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01040002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, <b class=verse-num id=v01040003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined. <b class=verse-num id=v01040004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.</p><p id=p01040004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And one night they both dreamed&#8212;the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison&#8212;each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v01040006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled. <b class=verse-num id=v01040007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So he asked Pharaoh&#8217;s officers who were with him in custody in his master&#8217;s house, &#8220;Why are your faces downcast today?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01040008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.&#8221; And Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01040008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, &#8220;In my dream there was a vine before me, <b class=verse-num id=v01040010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. <b class=verse-num id=v01040011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Pharaoh&#8217;s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01040012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to him, &#8220;This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <b class=verse-num id=v01040013-1>13&nbsp;</b>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer. <b class=verse-num id=v01040014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. <b class=verse-num id=v01040015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.&#8221;</p><p id=p01040015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01040016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, &#8220;I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head, <b class=verse-num id=v01040017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01040018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Joseph answered and said, &#8220;This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days. <b class=verse-num id=v01040019-1>19&nbsp;</b>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head&#8212;from you!&#8212;and hang you on a tree.

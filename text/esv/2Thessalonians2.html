<h3 id=p53002001_01-1>The Man of Lawlessness</h3><p id=p53002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v53002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, <b class=verse-num id=v53002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. <b class=verse-num id=v53002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, <b class=verse-num id=v53002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. <b class=verse-num id=v53002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? <b class=verse-num id=v53002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. <b class=verse-num id=v53002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. <b class=verse-num id=v53002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. <b class=verse-num id=v53002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, <b class=verse-num id=v53002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. <b class=verse-num id=v53002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, <b class=verse-num id=v53002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p><h3 id=p53002012_05-1>Stand Firm</h3><p id=p53002012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v53002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v53002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v53002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.</p><p id=p53002015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v53002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, <b class=verse-num id=v53002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.</p></div>

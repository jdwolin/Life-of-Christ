<h3 id=p47001001_01-1>Greeting</h3><p id=p47001001_02-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</p><p id=p47001001_02-1>To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:</p><p id=p47001001_02-1><b class=verse-num id=v47001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><h3 id=p47001002_02-1>God of All Comfort</h3><p id=p47001002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, <b class=verse-num id=v47001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. <b class=verse-num id=v47001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For as we share abundantly in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. <b class=verse-num id=v47001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. <b class=verse-num id=v47001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.</p><p id=p47001007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. <b class=verse-num id=v47001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v47001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. <b class=verse-num id=v47001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.</p><h3 id=p47001011_06-1>Paul&#8217;s Change of Plans</h3><p id=p47001011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v47001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. <b class=verse-num id=v47001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v47001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>just as you did partially understand us&#8212;that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.</p><p id=p47001014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v47001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. <b class=verse-num id=v47001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. <b class=verse-num id=v47001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say &#8220;Yes, yes&#8221; and &#8220;No, no&#8221; at the same time? <b class=verse-num id=v47001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. <b class=verse-num id=v47001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. <b class=verse-num id=v47001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. <b class=verse-num id=v47001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, <b class=verse-num id=v47001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</p><p id=p47001022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v47001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But I call God to witness against me&#8212;it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. <b class=verse-num id=v47001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</p></div>

<p id=p47002001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. <b class=verse-num id=v47002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? <b class=verse-num id=v47002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. <b class=verse-num id=v47002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</p><h3 id=p47002004_01-1>Forgive the Sinner</h3><p id=p47002004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v47002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure&#8212;not to put it too severely&#8212;to all of you. <b class=verse-num id=v47002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, <b class=verse-num id=v47002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. <b class=verse-num id=v47002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. <b class=verse-num id=v47002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. <b class=verse-num id=v47002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v47002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</p><h3 id=p47002011_04-1>Triumph in Christ</h3><p id=p47002011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v47002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, <b class=verse-num id=v47002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</p><p id=p47002013_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v47002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. <b class=verse-num id=v47002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, <b class=verse-num id=v47002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? <b class=verse-num id=v47002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God&#8217;s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</p></div>

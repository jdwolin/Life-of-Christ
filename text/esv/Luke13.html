No, I tell you, but rather division.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42012052-1>52&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42012053-1>53&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42012053_33-1>Interpreting the Time</h3><p id=p42012053_36-1><b class=verse-num id=v42012054-1>54&nbsp;</b>He also said to the crowds, <span class=woc>&#8220;When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, &#8216;A shower is coming.&#8217; And so it happens.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42012055-1>55&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, &#8216;There will be scorching heat,&#8217; and it happens.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42012056-1>56&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You hypocrites!

Then he took him and healed him and sent him away. <b class=verse-num id=v42014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they could not reply to these things.</p><h3 id=p42014006_08-1>The Parable of the Wedding Feast</h3><p id=p42014006_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v42014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and he who invited you both will come and say to you, &#8216;Give your place to this person,&#8217; and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, &#8216;Friend, move up higher.&#8217; Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42014011_14-1>The Parable of the Great Banquet</h3><p id=p42014011_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v42014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said also to the man who had invited him, <span class=woc>&#8220;When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42014014_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v42014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, &#8220;Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;A man once gave a great banquet and invited many.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, &#8216;Come, for everything is now ready.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, &#8216;I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And another said, &#8216;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And another said, &#8216;I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, &#8216;Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the servant said, &#8216;Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014023-1>23&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And the master said to the servant, &#8216;Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42014024_20-1>The Cost of Discipleship</h3><p id=p42014024_24-1><b class=verse-num id=v42014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014029-1>29&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>saying, &#8216;This man began to build and was not able to finish.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</span></p><h3 id=p42014033_24-1>Salt Without Taste Is Worthless</h3><p id=p42014033_29-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v42014034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42014035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile.

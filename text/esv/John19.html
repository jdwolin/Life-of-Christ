<h3 id=p43018001_01-1>Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h3><p id=p43018001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. <b class=verse-num id=v43018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. <b class=verse-num id=v43018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. <b class=verse-num id=v43018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am he.&#8221;</span> Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <b class=verse-num id=v43018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I am he,&#8221;</span> they drew back and fell to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v43018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So he asked them again, <span class=woc>&#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</span> And they said, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <span class=woc>&#8220;Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&#8217;s servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant&#8217;s name was Malchus.) <b class=verse-num id=v43018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to Peter, <span class=woc>&#8220;Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43018011_06-1>Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas</h3><p id=p43018011_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. <b class=verse-num id=v43018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. <b class=verse-num id=v43018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</p><h3 id=p43018014_11-1>Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id=p43018014_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, <b class=verse-num id=v43018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. <b class=verse-num id=v43018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The servant girl at the door said to Peter, &#8220;You also are not one of this man&#8217;s disciples, are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</p><h3 id=p43018018_14-1>The High Priest Questions Jesus</h3><p id=p43018018_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. <b class=verse-num id=v43018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43018021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, &#8220;Is that how you answer the high priest?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p><h3 id=p43018024_19-1>Peter Denies Jesus Again</h3><p id=p43018024_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, &#8220;You also are not one of his disciples, are you?&#8221; He denied it and said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &#8220;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.</p><h3 id=p43018027_23-1>Jesus Before Pilate</h3><p id=p43018027_26-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor&#8217;s headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor&#8217;s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. <b class=verse-num id=v43018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So Pilate went outside to them and said, &#8220;What accusation do you bring against this man?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&#8221; The Jews said to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.</p><h3 id=p43018032_26-1>My Kingdom Is Not of This World</h3><p id=p43018032_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Pilate answered, &#8220;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;So you are a king?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world&#8212;to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to him, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221;</p><p id=p43018038_33-1>After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, &#8220;I find no guilt in him. <b class=verse-num id=v43018039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018040-1>40&nbsp;</b>They cried out again, &#8220;Not this man, but Barabbas!&#8221; Now Barabbas was a robber.</p></div>

<h3 id=p43019001_01-1>Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified</h3><p id=p43019001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. <b class=verse-num id=v43019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe. <b class=verse-num id=v43019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>They came up to him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; and struck him with their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v43019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Pilate went out again and said to them, &#8220;See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &#8220;Behold the man!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, &#8220;Crucify him, crucify him!&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The Jews answered him, &#8220;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v43019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; But Jesus gave him no answer. <b class=verse-num id=v43019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Pilate said to him, &#8220;You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43019011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, &#8220;If you release this man, you are not Caesar&#8217;s friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. <b class=verse-num id=v43019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, &#8220;Behold your King!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They cried out, &#8220;Away with him, away with him, crucify him!&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Shall I crucify your King?&#8221; The chief priests answered, &#8220;We have no king but Caesar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.</p><h3 id=p43019016_06-1>The Crucifixion</h3><p id=p43019016_08-1>So they took Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v43019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. <b class=verse-num id=v43019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. <b class=verse-num id=v43019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v43019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &#8220;Do not write, &#8216;The King of the Jews,&#8217; but rather, &#8216;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Pilate answered, &#8220;What I have written I have written.&#8221;</p><p id=p43019022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, <b class=verse-num id=v43019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>so they said to one another, &#8220;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&#8221; This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p43019024_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;They divided my garments among them,</span><br /><span id=p43019024_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for my clothing they cast lots.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p43019024_08-1 class=same-paragraph>So the soldiers did these things, <b class=verse-num id=v43019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother&#8217;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <b class=verse-num id=v43019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, behold, your son!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then he said to the disciple, <span class=woc>&#8220;Behold, your mother!&#8221;</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p><h3 id=p43019027_08-1>The Death of Jesus</h3><p id=p43019027_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class=woc>&#8220;I thirst.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v43019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is finished,&#8221;</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p><h3 id=p43019030_12-1>Jesus&#8217; Side Is Pierced</h3><p id=p43019030_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. <b class=verse-num id=v43019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. <b class=verse-num id=v43019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <b class=verse-num id=v43019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. <b class=verse-num id=v43019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>He who saw it has borne witness&#8212;his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth&#8212;that you also may believe. <b class=verse-num id=v43019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: &#8220;Not one of his bones will be broken.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And again another Scripture says, &#8220;They will look on him whom they have pierced.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43019037_16-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p43019037_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v43019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. <b class=verse-num id=v43019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. <b class=verse-num id=v43019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v43019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. <b class=verse-num id=v43019042-1>42&nbsp;</b>So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p></div>

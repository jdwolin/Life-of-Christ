And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God, as his father David had done, <b class=verse-num id=v12016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even burned his son as an offering, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.</p><p id=p12016004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him. <b class=verse-num id=v12016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>At that time Rezin the king of Syria recovered Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah from Elath, and the Edomites came to Elath, where they dwell to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v12016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, &#8220;I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Ahaz also took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king&#8217;s house and sent a present to the king of Assyria. <b class=verse-num id=v12016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the king of Assyria listened to him. The king of Assyria marched up against Damascus and took it, carrying its people captive to Kir, and he killed Rezin.</p><p id=p12016009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details. <b class=verse-num id=v12016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Uriah the priest built the altar; in accordance with all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Uriah the priest made it, before King Ahaz arrived from Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v12016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when the king came from Damascus, the king viewed the altar. Then the king drew near to the altar and went up on it <b class=verse-num id=v12016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and burned his burnt offering and his grain offering and poured his drink offering and threw the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v12016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the bronze altar that was before the LORD he removed from the front of the house, from the place between his altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of his altar. <b class=verse-num id=v12016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, &#8220;On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering and the king&#8217;s burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. And throw on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice, but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Uriah the priest did all this, as King Ahaz commanded.</p><p id=p12016016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands and removed the basin from them, and he took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone pedestal. <b class=verse-num id=v12016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the covered way for the Sabbath that had been built inside the house and the outer entrance for the king he caused to go around the house of the LORD, because of the king of Assyria. <b class=verse-num id=v12016019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? <b class=verse-num id=v12016020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

<h3 id=p12017001_01-1>Hoshea Reigns in Israel</h3><p id=p12017001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, and he reigned nine years. <b class=verse-num id=v12017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v12017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria. And Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. <b class=verse-num id=v12017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison. <b class=verse-num id=v12017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria, and for three years he besieged it.</p><h3 id=p12017005_05-1>The Fall of Israel</h3><p id=p12017005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p><h3 id=p12017006_09-1>Exile Because of Idolatry</h3><p id=p12017006_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And this occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods <b class=verse-num id=v12017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had practiced. <b class=verse-num id=v12017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did secretly against the LORD their God things that were not right. They built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city. <b class=verse-num id=v12017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, <b class=verse-num id=v12017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. And they did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger, <b class=verse-num id=v12017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, &#8220;You shall not do this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, &#8220;Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the Law that I commanded your fathers, and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.&#8221;</p><p id=p12017013_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had been, who did not believe in the LORD their God. <b class=verse-num id=v12017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They despised his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and the warnings that he gave them. They went after false idols and became false, and they followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should not do like them. <b class=verse-num id=v12017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves metal images of two calves; and they made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal. <b class=verse-num id=v12017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings and used divination and omens and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v12017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. None was left but the tribe of Judah only.</p><p id=p12017018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. <b class=verse-num id=v12017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</p><p id=p12017020_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When he had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD and made them commit great sin. <b class=verse-num id=v12017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel walked in all the sins that Jeroboam did. They did not depart from them, <b class=verse-num id=v12017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had spoken by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria until this day.</p><h3 id=p12017023_13-1>Assyria Resettles Samaria</h3><p id=p12017023_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel. And they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. <b class=verse-num id=v12017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the LORD. Therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them. <b class=verse-num id=v12017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So the king of Assyria was told, &#8220;The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the god of the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Assyria commanded, &#8220;Send there one of the priests whom you carried away from there, and let him go and dwell there and teach them the law of the god of the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</p><p id=p12017028_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities in which they lived. <b class=verse-num id=v12017030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, <b class=verse-num id=v12017031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. <b class=verse-num id=v12017032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places. <b class=verse-num id=v12017033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So they feared the LORD but also served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</p><p id=p12017033_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017034-1>34&nbsp;</b>To this day they do according to the former manner. They do not fear the LORD, and they do not follow the statutes or the rules or the law or the commandment that the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v12017035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The LORD made a covenant with them and commanded them, &#8220;You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them, <b class=verse-num id=v12017036-1>36&nbsp;</b>but you shall fear the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm. You shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v12017037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And the statutes and the rules and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall not fear other gods, <b class=verse-num id=v12017038-1>38&nbsp;</b>and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods, <b class=verse-num id=v12017039-1>39&nbsp;</b>but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12017040-1>40&nbsp;</b>However, they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.</p><p id=p12017040_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v12017041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So these nations feared the LORD and also served their carved images. Their children did likewise, and their children&#8217;s children&#8212;as their fathers did, so they do to this day.</p></div>

His mother&#8217;s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. <b class=verse-num id=v12018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. <b class=verse-num id=v12018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>He removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan). <b class=verse-num id=v12018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before him. <b class=verse-num id=v12018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For he held fast to the LORD. He did not depart from following him, but kept the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v12018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the LORD was with him; wherever he went out, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and would not serve him. <b class=verse-num id=v12018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He struck down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.</p><p id=p12018008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it, <b class=verse-num id=v12018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and at the end of three years he took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. <b class=verse-num id=v12018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The king of Assyria carried the Israelites away to Assyria and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, <b class=verse-num id=v12018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.

Whatever you impose on me I will bear.&#8221; And the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. <b class=verse-num id=v12018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v12018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the doorposts that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria. <b class=verse-num id=v12018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer&#8217;s Field. <b class=verse-num id=v12018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when they called for the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.</p><p id=p12018018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Say to Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours? <b class=verse-num id=v12018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war?

The LORD said to me, &#8220;Go up against this land and destroy it.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p12018025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v12018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it.

Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?

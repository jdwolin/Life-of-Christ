<h3 id=p44005001_01-1>Ananias and Sapphira</h3><p id=p44005001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, <b class=verse-num id=v44005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and with his wife&#8217;s knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles&#8217; feet. <b class=verse-num id=v44005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Peter said, &#8220;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? <b class=verse-num id=v44005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. <b class=verse-num id=v44005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.</p><p id=p44005006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v44005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to her, &#8220;Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Yes, for so much.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Peter said to her, &#8220;How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v44005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.</p><h3 id=p44005011_04-1>Many Signs and Wonders Done</h3><p id=p44005011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon&#8217;s Portico. <b class=verse-num id=v44005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem. <b class=verse-num id=v44005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, <b class=verse-num id=v44005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</p><h3 id=p44005016_09-1>The Apostles Arrested and Freed</h3><p id=p44005016_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy <b class=verse-num id=v44005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison. <b class=verse-num id=v44005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, <b class=verse-num id=v44005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.</p><p id=p44005021_14-1>Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council, all the senate of the people of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. <b class=verse-num id=v44005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported, <b class=verse-num id=v44005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. <b class=verse-num id=v44005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And someone came and told them, &#8220;Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</p><p id=p44005026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, <b class=verse-num id=v44005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man&#8217;s blood upon us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But Peter and the apostles answered, &#8220;We must obey God rather than men. <b class=verse-num id=v44005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. <b class=verse-num id=v44005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. <b class=verse-num id=v44005032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44005032_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005033-1>33&nbsp;</b>When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. <b class=verse-num id=v44005034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while. <b class=verse-num id=v44005035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men. <b class=verse-num id=v44005036-1>36&nbsp;</b>For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v44005037-1>37&nbsp;</b>After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered. <b class=verse-num id=v44005038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail; <b class=verse-num id=v44005039-1>39&nbsp;</b>but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!&#8221; So they took his advice, <b class=verse-num id=v44005040-1>40&nbsp;</b>and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <b class=verse-num id=v44005041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. <b class=verse-num id=v44005042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Christ is Jesus.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44007001_01-1>Stephen&#8217;s Speech</h3><p id=p44007001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>And the high priest said, &#8220;Are these things so?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Stephen said:</p><p id=p44007002_03-1>&#8220;Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, <b class=verse-num id=v44007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8216;Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. <b class=verse-num id=v44007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot&#8217;s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. <b class=verse-num id=v44007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And God spoke to this effect&#8212;that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. <b class=verse-num id=v44007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8216;But I will judge the nation that they serve,&#8217; said God, &#8216;and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</p><p id=p44007008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him <b class=verse-num id=v44007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. <b class=verse-num id=v44007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. <b class=verse-num id=v44007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit. <b class=verse-num id=v44007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph&#8217;s family became known to Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v44007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. <b class=verse-num id=v44007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v44007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</p><p id=p44007016_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt <b class=verse-num id=v44007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v44007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God&#8217;s sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father&#8217;s house, <b class=verse-num id=v44007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and when he was exposed, Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. <b class=verse-num id=v44007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</p><p id=p44007022_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v44007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v44007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. <b class=verse-num id=v44007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand. <b class=verse-num id=v44007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, &#8216;Men, you are brothers.

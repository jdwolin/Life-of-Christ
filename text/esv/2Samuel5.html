He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p><p id=p10004004_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest. <b class=verse-num id=v10004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v10004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him. They took his head and went by the way of the Arabah all night, <b class=verse-num id=v10004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, &#8220;Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, &#8220;As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity, <b class=verse-num id=v10004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>when one told me, &#8216;Behold, Saul is dead,&#8217; and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. <b class=verse-num id=v10004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.</p></div>

And the LORD said to you, &#8216;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v10005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</p><p id=p10005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, &#8220;You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off&#8221;&#8212;thinking, &#8220;David cannot come in here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. <b class=verse-num id=v10005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David said on that day, &#8220;Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack &#8216;the lame and the blind,&#8217; who are hated by David&#8217;s soul.&#8221; Therefore it is said, &#8220;The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward. <b class=verse-num id=v10005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.</p><p id=p10005010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house. <b class=verse-num id=v10005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And David knew that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p><p id=p10005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David. <b class=verse-num id=v10005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <b class=verse-num id=v10005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, <b class=verse-num id=v10005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p><h3 id=p10005016_06-1>David Defeats the Philistines</h3><p id=p10005016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold. <b class=verse-num id=v10005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And David inquired of the LORD, &#8220;Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?&#8221; And the LORD said to David, &#8220;Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there.

And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart, <b class=verse-num id=v10006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.</p><h3 id=p10006004_06-1>Uzzah and the Ark</h3><p id=p10006004_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals. <b class=verse-num id=v10006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. <b class=verse-num id=v10006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God. <b class=verse-num id=v10006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah.

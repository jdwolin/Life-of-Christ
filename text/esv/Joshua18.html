<p id=p06017001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>Then allotment was made to the people of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. <b class=verse-num id=v06017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their clans.</p><p id=p06017002_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v06017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <b class=verse-num id=v06017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, &#8220;The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers.&#8221; So according to the mouth of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father. <b class=verse-num id=v06017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan, <b class=verse-num id=v06017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh.</p><p id=p06017006_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v06017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. <b class=verse-num id=v06017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim. <b class=verse-num id=v06017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea, <b class=verse-num id=v06017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>the land to the south being Ephraim&#8217;s and that to the north being Manasseh&#8217;s, with the sea forming its boundary. On the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar. <b class=verse-num id=v06017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Also in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Naphath. <b class=verse-num id=v06017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. <b class=verse-num id=v06017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.</p><p id=p06017013_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v06017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, &#8220;Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a numerous people, since all along the LORD has blessed me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to them, &#8220;If you are a numerous people, go up by yourselves to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The people of Joseph said, &#8220;The hill country is not enough for us. Yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of Jezreel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, &#8220;You are a numerous people and have great power. You shall not have one allotment only, <b class=verse-num id=v06017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.&#8221;</p></div>

The land lay subdued before them.</p><p id=p06018001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned. <b class=verse-num id=v06018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Joshua said to the people of Israel, &#8220;How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land, which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? <b class=verse-num id=v06018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land. They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me. <b class=verse-num id=v06018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall continue in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v06018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. <b class=verse-num id=v06018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their heritage. And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.&#8221;</p><p id=p06018007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the men arose and went, and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, &#8220;Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions. Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh, <b class=verse-num id=v06018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel, to each his portion.</p><h3 id=p06018010_06-1>The Inheritance for Benjamin</h3><p id=p06018010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The lot of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to its clans came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v06018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan. Then the boundary goes up to the shoulder north of Jericho, then up through the hill country westward, and it ends at the wilderness of Beth-aven. <b class=verse-num id=v06018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the shoulder of Luz (that is, Bethel), then the boundary goes down to Ataroth-addar, on the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon. <b class=verse-num id=v06018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary goes in another direction, turning on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south, opposite Beth-horon, and it ends at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city belonging to the people of Judah. This forms the western side. <b class=verse-num id=v06018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim. And the boundary goes from there to Ephron, to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. <b class=verse-num id=v06018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim. And it then goes down the Valley of Hinnom, south of the shoulder of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel. <b class=verse-num id=v06018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh, and from there goes to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim.

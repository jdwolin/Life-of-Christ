<h3 id=p44018001_01-1>Paul in Corinth</h3><p id=p44018001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. <b class=verse-num id=v44018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them, <b class=verse-num id=v44018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. <b class=verse-num id=v44018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.</p><p id=p44018004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, &#8220;Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue. <b class=verse-num id=v44018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. <b class=verse-num id=v44018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44018010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p><p id=p44018011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal, <b class=verse-num id=v44018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &#8220;If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint. <b class=verse-num id=v44018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he drove them from the tribunal. <b class=verse-num id=v44018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.</p><h3 id=p44018017_04-1>Paul Returns to Antioch</h3><p id=p44018017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow. <b class=verse-num id=v44018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined. <b class=verse-num id=v44018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But on taking leave of them he said, &#8220;I will return to you if God wills,&#8221; and he set sail from Ephesus.</p><p id=p44018021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch. <b class=verse-num id=v44018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</p><h3 id=p44018023_08-1>Apollos Speaks Boldly in Ephesus</h3><p id=p44018023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures. <b class=verse-num id=v44018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. <b class=verse-num id=v44018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. <b class=verse-num id=v44018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, <b class=verse-num id=v44018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</p></div>

<h3 id=p44019001_01-1>Paul in Ephesus</h3><p id=p44019001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. <b class=verse-num id=v44019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Into what then were you baptized?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Into John&#8217;s baptism.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. <b class=verse-num id=v44019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>There were about twelve men in all.</p><p id=p44019007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. <b class=verse-num id=v44019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</p><h3 id=p44019010_04-1>The Sons of Sceva</h3><p id=p44019010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, <b class=verse-num id=v44019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, &#8220;I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. <b class=verse-num id=v44019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the evil spirit answered them, &#8220;Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <b class=verse-num id=v44019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. <b class=verse-num id=v44019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. <b class=verse-num id=v44019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v44019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.</p><h3 id=p44019020_08-1>A Riot at Ephesus</h3><p id=p44019020_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</p><p id=p44019022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way. <b class=verse-num id=v44019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. <b class=verse-num id=v44019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, &#8220;Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. <b class=verse-num id=v44019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v44019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.&#8221;</p><p id=p44019027_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, &#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul&#8217;s companions in travel. <b class=verse-num id=v44019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him. <b class=verse-num id=v44019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater. <b class=verse-num id=v44019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. <b class=verse-num id=v44019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v44019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, &#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221;</p><p id=p44019034_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, &#8220;Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? <b class=verse-num id=v44019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. <b class=verse-num id=v44019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. <b class=verse-num id=v44019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. <b class=verse-num id=v44019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v44019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p></div>

And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, &#8220;Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. <b class=verse-num id=v44020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.</p><p id=p44020012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land. <b class=verse-num id=v44020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. <b class=verse-num id=v44020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus. <b class=verse-num id=v44020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</p><h3 id=p44020016_11-1>Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders</h3><p id=p44020016_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. <b class=verse-num id=v44020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when they came to him, he said to them:</p><p id=p44020018_17-1>&#8220;You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, <b class=verse-num id=v44020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; <b class=verse-num id=v44020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, <b class=verse-num id=v44020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v44020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, <b class=verse-num id=v44020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. <b class=verse-num id=v44020024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. <b class=verse-num id=v44020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, <b class=verse-num id=v44020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. <b class=verse-num id=v44020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; <b class=verse-num id=v44020030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. <b class=verse-num id=v44020031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. <b class=verse-num id=v44020032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. <b class=verse-num id=v44020033-1>33&nbsp;</b>I coveted no one&#8217;s silver or gold or apparel. <b class=verse-num id=v44020034-1>34&nbsp;</b>You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. <b class=verse-num id=v44020035-1>35&nbsp;</b>In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, <span class=woc>&#8216;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8217;</span>&#8221;</p><p id=p44020035_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44020036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. <b class=verse-num id=v44020037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him, <b class=verse-num id=v44020038-1>38&nbsp;</b>being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again.

The old commandment is the word that you have heard. <b class=verse-num id=v62002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. <b class=verse-num id=v62002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. <b class=verse-num id=v62002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. <b class=verse-num id=v62002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p62002012_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v62002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you, little children,</span><br /><span id=p62002012_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because your sins are forgiven for his name&#8217;s sake.</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v62002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you, fathers,</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you know him who is from the beginning.</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you, young men,</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you have overcome the evil one.</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you, children,</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you know the Father.</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v62002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you, fathers,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you know him who is from the beginning.</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you, young men,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you are strong,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the word of God abides in you,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have overcome the evil one.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p62002014_07-1>Do Not Love the World</h3><p id=p62002014_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <b class=verse-num id=v62002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For all that is in the world&#8212;the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life&#8212;is not from the Father but is from the world. <b class=verse-num id=v62002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.</p><h3 id=p62002017_12-1>Warning Concerning Antichrists</h3><p id=p62002017_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. <b class=verse-num id=v62002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. <b class=verse-num id=v62002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. <b class=verse-num id=v62002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v62002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. <b class=verse-num id=v62002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. <b class=verse-num id=v62002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. <b class=verse-num id=v62002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And this is the promise that he made to us&#8212;eternal life.</p><p id=p62002025_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. <b class=verse-num id=v62002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie&#8212;just as it has taught you, abide in him.</p><h3 id=p62002027_15-1>Children of God</h3><p id=p62002027_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. <b class=verse-num id=v62002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.</p></div>

And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. <b class=verse-num id=v06003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>At the end of three days the officers went through the camp <b class=verse-num id=v06003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and commanded the people, &#8220;As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it. <b class=verse-num id=v06003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits in length. Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said to the people, &#8220;Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to the priests, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people.&#8221; So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</p><p id=p06003006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. <b class=verse-num id=v06003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, &#8216;When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to the people of Israel, &#8220;Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, &#8220;Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. <b class=verse-num id=v06003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v06003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man. <b class=verse-num id=v06003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap.&#8221;</p><p id=p06003013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, <b class=verse-num id=v06003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), <b class=verse-num id=v06003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v06003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.</p></div>

For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</p><p id=p06005007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. <b class=verse-num id=v06005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#8221; And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.</p><h3 id=p06005009_05-1>First Passover in Canaan</h3><p id=p06005009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v06005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. <b class=verse-num id=v06005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p><h3 id=p06005012_09-1>The Commander of the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span>&#8217;s Army</h3><p id=p06005012_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, &#8220;Are you for us, or for our adversaries?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD.

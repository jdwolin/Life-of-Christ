Rather train yourself for godliness; <b class=verse-num id=v54004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. <b class=verse-num id=v54004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. <b class=verse-num id=v54004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.</p><p id=p54004010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v54004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Command and teach these things. <b class=verse-num id=v54004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. <b class=verse-num id=v54004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. <b class=verse-num id=v54004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you. <b class=verse-num id=v54004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, so that all may see your progress. <b class=verse-num id=v54004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.</p></div>

Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are truly widows.</p><p id=p54005016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v54005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. <b class=verse-num id=v54005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For the Scripture says, &#8220;You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,&#8221; and, <span class=woc>&#8220;The laborer deserves his wages.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v54005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. <b class=verse-num id=v54005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear. <b class=verse-num id=v54005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality. <b class=verse-num id=v54005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor take part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure. <b class=verse-num id=v54005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.) <b class=verse-num id=v54005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later. <b class=verse-num id=v54005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.</p></div>

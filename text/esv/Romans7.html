<h3 id=p45006001_01-1>Dead to Sin, Alive to God</h3><p id=p45006001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? <b class=verse-num id=v45006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? <b class=verse-num id=v45006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <b class=verse-num id=v45006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p><p id=p45006004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. <b class=verse-num id=v45006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For one who has died has been set free from sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. <b class=verse-num id=v45006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. <b class=verse-num id=v45006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. <b class=verse-num id=v45006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p><p id=p45006011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. <b class=verse-num id=v45006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</p><h3 id=p45006014_07-1>Slaves to Righteousness</h3><p id=p45006014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! <b class=verse-num id=v45006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? <b class=verse-num id=v45006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, <b class=verse-num id=v45006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.</p><p id=p45006019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. <b class=verse-num id=v45006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. <b class=verse-num id=v45006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45007001_01-1>Released from the Law</h3><p id=p45007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know, brothers&#8212;for I am speaking to those who know the law&#8212;that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives? <b class=verse-num id=v45007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. <b class=verse-num id=v45007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</p><p id=p45007003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. <b class=verse-num id=v45007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. <b class=verse-num id=v45007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.</p><h3 id=p45007006_05-1>The Law and Sin</h3><p id=p45007006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, &#8220;You shall not covet.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. <b class=verse-num id=v45007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. <b class=verse-num id=v45007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me. <b class=verse-num id=v45007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. <b class=verse-num id=v45007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</p><p id=p45007012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. <b class=verse-num id=v45007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. <b class=verse-num id=v45007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. <b class=verse-num id=v45007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. <b class=verse-num id=v45007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. <b class=verse-num id=v45007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. <b class=verse-num id=v45007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. <b class=verse-num id=v45007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</p><p id=p45007020_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. <b class=verse-num id=v45007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, <b class=verse-num id=v45007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. <b class=verse-num id=v45007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? <b class=verse-num id=v45007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45008001_01-1>Life in the Spirit</h3><p id=p45008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v45008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. <b class=verse-num id=v45008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, <b class=verse-num id=v45008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v45008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v45008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. <b class=verse-num id=v45008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God&#8217;s law; indeed, it cannot. <b class=verse-num id=v45008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</p><p id=p45008008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. <b class=verse-num id=v45008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p><h3 id=p45008011_05-1>Heirs with Christ</h3><p id=p45008011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v45008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. <b class=verse-num id=v45008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, &#8220;Abba! Father!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, <b class=verse-num id=v45008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and if children, then heirs&#8212;heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p><h3 id=p45008017_08-1>Future Glory</h3><p id=p45008017_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. <b class=verse-num id=v45008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope <b class=verse-num id=v45008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. <b class=verse-num id=v45008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <b class=verse-num id=v45008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? <b class=verse-num id=v45008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p><p id=p45008025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. <b class=verse-num id=v45008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. <b class=verse-num id=v45008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v45008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p><h3 id=p45008030_10-1>God&#8217;s Everlasting Love</h3><p id=p45008030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v45008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? <b class=verse-num id=v45008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? <b class=verse-num id=v45008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Who shall bring any charge against God&#8217;s elect? It is God who justifies. <b class=verse-num id=v45008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died&#8212;more than that, who was raised&#8212;who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. <b class=verse-num id=v45008035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

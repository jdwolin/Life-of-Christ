<h3 id=p44003001_01-1>The Lame Beggar Healed</h3><p id=p44003001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. <b class=verse-num id=v44003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v44003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. <b class=verse-num id=v44003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, &#8220;Look at us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. <b class=verse-num id=v44003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But Peter said, &#8220;I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. <b class=verse-num id=v44003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. <b class=verse-num id=v44003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And all the people saw him walking and praising God, <b class=verse-num id=v44003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p><h3 id=p44003010_05-1>Peter Speaks in Solomon&#8217;s Portico</h3><p id=p44003010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v44003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: &#8220;Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? <b class=verse-num id=v44003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. <b class=verse-num id=v44003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, <b class=verse-num id=v44003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. <b class=verse-num id=v44003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And his name&#8212;by faith in his name&#8212;has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.</p><p id=p44003016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. <b class=verse-num id=v44003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. <b class=verse-num id=v44003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, <b class=verse-num id=v44003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v44003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. <b class=verse-num id=v44003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8216;The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. <b class=verse-num id=v44003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days. <b class=verse-num id=v44003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, &#8216;And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.&#8221;</p></div>

And they recognized that they had been with Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. <b class=verse-num id=v44004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, <b class=verse-num id=v44004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. <b class=verse-num id=v44004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But Peter and John answered them, &#8220;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, <b class=verse-num id=v44004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v44004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.</p><h3 id=p44004022_07-1>The Believers Pray for Boldness</h3><p id=p44004022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. <b class=verse-num id=v44004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, &#8220;Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, <b class=verse-num id=v44004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44004025_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Why did the Gentiles rage,</span><br /><span id=p44004025_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples plot in vain?</span><br /><span id=p44004026_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings of the earth set themselves,</span><br /><span id=p44004026_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rulers were gathered together,</span><br /><span id=p44004026_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the Lord and against his Anointed&#8217;&#8212;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44004026_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v44004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. <b class=verse-num id=v44004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, <b class=verse-num id=v44004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.</p><h3 id=p44004031_12-1>They Had Everything in Common</h3><p id=p44004031_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44004032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. <b class=verse-num id=v44004033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. <b class=verse-num id=v44004034-1>34&nbsp;</b>There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold <b class=verse-num id=v44004035-1>35&nbsp;</b>and laid it at the apostles&#8217; feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. <b class=verse-num id=v44004036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, <b class=verse-num id=v44004037-1>37&nbsp;</b>sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles&#8217; feet.</p></div>

And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. <b class=verse-num id=v44005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.</p><p id=p44005006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v44005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to her, &#8220;Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Yes, for so much.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Peter said to her, &#8220;How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v44005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.</p><h3 id=p44005011_04-1>Many Signs and Wonders Done</h3><p id=p44005011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon&#8217;s Portico. <b class=verse-num id=v44005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem. <b class=verse-num id=v44005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, <b class=verse-num id=v44005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</p><h3 id=p44005016_09-1>The Apostles Arrested and Freed</h3><p id=p44005016_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy <b class=verse-num id=v44005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison. <b class=verse-num id=v44005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, <b class=verse-num id=v44005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.</p><p id=p44005021_14-1>Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council, all the senate of the people of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. <b class=verse-num id=v44005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported, <b class=verse-num id=v44005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. <b class=verse-num id=v44005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And someone came and told them, &#8220;Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</p><p id=p44005026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, <b class=verse-num id=v44005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man&#8217;s blood upon us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But Peter and the apostles answered, &#8220;We must obey God rather than men. <b class=verse-num id=v44005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. <b class=verse-num id=v44005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. <b class=verse-num id=v44005032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.&#8221;</p><p id=p44005032_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44005033-1>33&nbsp;</b>When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. <b class=verse-num id=v44005034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while. <b class=verse-num id=v44005035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men. <b class=verse-num id=v44005036-1>36&nbsp;</b>For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v44005037-1>37&nbsp;</b>After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered. <b class=verse-num id=v44005038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail; <b class=verse-num id=v44005039-1>39&nbsp;</b>but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!&#8221; So they took his advice, <b class=verse-num id=v44005040-1>40&nbsp;</b>and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <b class=verse-num id=v44005041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. <b class=verse-num id=v44005042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Christ is Jesus.</p></div>

When your children ask in time to come, &#8216;What do those stones mean to you?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever.&#8221;</p><p id=p06004007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v06004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the LORD told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down there. <b class=verse-num id=v06004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v06004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua.</p><p id=p06004010_07-1>The people passed over in haste. <b class=verse-num id=v06004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people. <b class=verse-num id=v06004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them. <b class=verse-num id=v06004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v06004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.</p><p id=p06004014_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v06004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, <b class=verse-num id=v06004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Joshua commanded the priests, &#8220;Come up out of the Jordan.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests&#8217; feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.</p><p id=p06004018_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v06004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v06004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal. <b class=verse-num id=v06004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people of Israel, &#8220;When your children ask their fathers in times to come, &#8216;What do these stones mean?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>then you shall let your children know, &#8216;Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over, <b class=verse-num id=v06004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, that you may fear the LORD your God forever.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p06005001_01-1>The New Generation Circumcised</h3><p id=p06005001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.</p><p id=p06005001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. <b class=verse-num id=v06005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v06005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v06005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD; the LORD swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. <b class=verse-num id=v06005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</p><p id=p06005007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. <b class=verse-num id=v06005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#8221; And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.</p><h3 id=p06005009_05-1>First Passover in Canaan</h3><p id=p06005009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v06005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. <b class=verse-num id=v06005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p><h3 id=p06005012_09-1>The Commander of the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span>&#8217;s Army</h3><p id=p06005012_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, &#8220;Are you for us, or for our adversaries?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD.

None went out, and none came in. <b class=verse-num id=v06006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor. <b class=verse-num id=v06006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days. <b class=verse-num id=v06006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. <b class=verse-num id=v06006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when they make a long blast with the ram&#8217;s horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people, &#8220;Go forward. March around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p06006007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them. <b class=verse-num id=v06006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually. <b class=verse-num id=v06006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Joshua commanded the people, &#8220;You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.</p><p id=p06006011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually. <b class=verse-num id=v06006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.</p><p id=p06006014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. <b class=verse-num id=v06006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, &#8220;Shout, for the LORD has given you the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. <b class=verse-num id=v06006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it. <b class=verse-num id=v06006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.</p><p id=p06006021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, &#8220;Go into the prostitute&#8217;s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But Rahab the prostitute and her father&#8217;s household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p><p id=p06006025_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, &#8220;Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho.</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;At the cost of his firstborn shall he</span><br /><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lay its foundation,</span><br /><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and at the cost of his youngest son</span><br /><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall he set up its gates.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p06006026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.</p></div>

He wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.</p><p id=p10023008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew. <b class=verse-num id=v10023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.</p><p id=p10023010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v10023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD worked a great victory.</p><p id=p10023012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. <b class=verse-num id=v10023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And David said longingly, &#8220;Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the LORD <b class=verse-num id=v10023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?&#8221; Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.</p><p id=p10023017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them and won a name beside the three. <b class=verse-num id=v10023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.</p><p id=p10023019_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. <b class=verse-num id=v10023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian&#8217;s hand and killed him with his own spear. <b class=verse-num id=v10023022-1>22&nbsp;</b>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men. <b class=verse-num id=v10023023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.</p><p id=p10023023_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v10023024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, <b class=verse-num id=v10023025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod, <b class=verse-num id=v10023026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, <b class=verse-num id=v10023027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Abiezer of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite, <b class=verse-num id=v10023028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah, <b class=verse-num id=v10023029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Heleb the son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the people of Benjamin, <b class=verse-num id=v10023030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, <b class=verse-num id=v10023031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Bahurim, <b class=verse-num id=v10023032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, <b class=verse-num id=v10023033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, <b class=verse-num id=v10023034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, <b class=verse-num id=v10023035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Hezro of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite, <b class=verse-num id=v10023036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, <b class=verse-num id=v10023037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, <b class=verse-num id=v10023038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, <b class=verse-num id=v10023039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.</p></div>

And David said to the LORD, &#8220;I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v10024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go and say to David, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you.

I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing.&#8221; So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v10024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.</p></div>

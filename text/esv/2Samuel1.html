<h3 id=p10001001_01-1>David Hears of Saul&#8217;s Death</h3><p id=p10001001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. <b class=verse-num id=v10001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul&#8217;s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage. <b class=verse-num id=v10001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>David said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And David said to him, &#8220;How did it go? Tell me.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the young man who told him said, &#8220;By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. <b class=verse-num id=v10001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; I answered him, &#8216;I am an Amalekite.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8216;Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;</p><p id=p10001010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v10001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>David said to him, &#8220;How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD&#8217;s anointed?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then David called one of the young men and said, &#8220;Go, execute him.&#8221; And he struck him down so that he died. <b class=verse-num id=v10001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And David said to him, &#8220;Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &#8216;I have killed the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10001016_06-1>David&#8217;s Lament for Saul and Jonathan</h3><p id=p10001016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son, <b class=verse-num id=v10001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar.

And I will do good to you because you have done this thing. <b class=verse-num id=v10002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10002007_06-1>Ish-bosheth Made King of Israel</h3><p id=p10002007_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul&#8217;s army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim, <b class=verse-num id=v10002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Ish-bosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. <b class=verse-num id=v10002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p><h3 id=p10002011_11-1>The Battle of Gibeon</h3><p id=p10002011_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v10002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <b class=verse-num id=v10002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Abner said to Joab, &#8220;Let the young men arise and compete before us.&#8221; And Joab said, &#8220;Let them arise.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. <b class=verse-num id=v10002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent&#8217;s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v10002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.</p><p id=p10002017_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle. <b class=verse-num id=v10002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <b class=verse-num id=v10002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Abner looked behind him and said, &#8220;Is it you, Asahel?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;It is I.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Abner said to him, &#8220;Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil.&#8221; But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <b class=verse-num id=v10002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Abner said again to Asahel, &#8220;Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.</p><p id=p10002023_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. <b class=verse-num id=v10002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill. <b class=verse-num id=v10002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Abner called to Joab, &#8220;Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Joab said, &#8220;As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.</p><p id=p10002028_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v10002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim. <b class=verse-num id=v10002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David&#8217;s servants nineteen men besides Asahel. <b class=verse-num id=v10002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner&#8217;s men. <b class=verse-num id=v10002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</p></div>

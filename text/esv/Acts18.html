<h3 id=p44017001_01-1>Paul and Silas in Thessalonica</h3><p id=p44017001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <b class=verse-num id=v44017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, &#8220;This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. <b class=verse-num id=v44017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v44017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, &#8220;These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, <b class=verse-num id=v44017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things. <b class=verse-num id=v44017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</p><h3 id=p44017009_06-1>Paul and Silas in Berea</h3><p id=p44017009_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. <b class=verse-num id=v44017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. <b class=verse-num id=v44017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. <b class=verse-num id=v44017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v44017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. <b class=verse-num id=v44017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.</p><h3 id=p44017015_11-1>Paul in Athens</h3><p id=p44017015_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. <b class=verse-num id=v44017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. <b class=verse-num id=v44017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, &#8220;What does this babbler wish to say?&#8221; Others said, &#8220;He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities&#8221;&#8212;because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. <b class=verse-num id=v44017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &#8220;May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <b class=verse-num id=v44017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.</p><h3 id=p44017021_14-1>Paul Addresses the Areopagus</h3><p id=p44017021_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: &#8220;Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. <b class=verse-num id=v44017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#8216;To the unknown god.&#8217; What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. <b class=verse-num id=v44017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, <b class=verse-num id=v44017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. <b class=verse-num id=v44017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, <b class=verse-num id=v44017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, <b class=verse-num id=v44017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44017028_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;In him we live and move and have our being&#8217;;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44017028_18-1 class=same-paragraph>as even some of your own poets have said,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44017028_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;For we are indeed his offspring.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44017028_18-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Being then God&#8217;s offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man. <b class=verse-num id=v44017030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, <b class=verse-num id=v44017031-1>31&nbsp;</b>because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.&#8221;</p><p id=p44017031_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44017032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, &#8220;We will hear you again about this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44017033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So Paul went out from their midst. <b class=verse-num id=v44017034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</p></div>

And he went to see them, <b class=verse-num id=v44018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. <b class=verse-num id=v44018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.</p><p id=p44018004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, &#8220;Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue. <b class=verse-num id=v44018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. <b class=verse-num id=v44018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44018010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p><p id=p44018011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal, <b class=verse-num id=v44018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &#8220;If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint. <b class=verse-num id=v44018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he drove them from the tribunal. <b class=verse-num id=v44018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.</p><h3 id=p44018017_04-1>Paul Returns to Antioch</h3><p id=p44018017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow. <b class=verse-num id=v44018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v44018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined. <b class=verse-num id=v44018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But on taking leave of them he said, &#8220;I will return to you if God wills,&#8221; and he set sail from Ephesus.</p><p id=p44018021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch. <b class=verse-num id=v44018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</p><h3 id=p44018023_08-1>Apollos Speaks Boldly in Ephesus</h3><p id=p44018023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures. <b class=verse-num id=v44018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. <b class=verse-num id=v44018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. <b class=verse-num id=v44018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, <b class=verse-num id=v44018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</p></div>

There he found some disciples. <b class=verse-num id=v44019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Into what then were you baptized?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Into John&#8217;s baptism.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. <b class=verse-num id=v44019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>There were about twelve men in all.</p><p id=p44019007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. <b class=verse-num id=v44019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</p><h3 id=p44019010_04-1>The Sons of Sceva</h3><p id=p44019010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, <b class=verse-num id=v44019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, &#8220;I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. <b class=verse-num id=v44019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the evil spirit answered them, &#8220;Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <b class=verse-num id=v44019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. <b class=verse-num id=v44019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. <b class=verse-num id=v44019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v44019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.</p><h3 id=p44019020_08-1>A Riot at Ephesus</h3><p id=p44019020_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</p><p id=p44019022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way. <b class=verse-num id=v44019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. <b class=verse-num id=v44019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, &#8220;Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. <b class=verse-num id=v44019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v44019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.&#8221;</p><p id=p44019027_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, &#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul&#8217;s companions in travel. <b class=verse-num id=v44019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him. <b class=verse-num id=v44019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater. <b class=verse-num id=v44019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. <b class=verse-num id=v44019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v44019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, &#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221;</p><p id=p44019034_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, &#8220;Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? <b class=verse-num id=v44019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. <b class=verse-num id=v44019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. <b class=verse-num id=v44019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. <b class=verse-num id=v44019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v44019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p></div>

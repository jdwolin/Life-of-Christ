<h3 id=p06002001_01-1>Rahab Hides the Spies</h3><p id=p06002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, &#8220;Go, view the land, especially Jericho.&#8221; And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab and lodged there. <b class=verse-num id=v06002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And it was told to the king of Jericho, &#8220;Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, &#8220;Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, &#8220;True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. <b class=verse-num id=v06002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof. <b class=verse-num id=v06002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out.</p><p id=p06002007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Before the men lay down, she came up to them on the roof <b class=verse-num id=v06002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and said to the men, &#8220;I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. <b class=verse-num id=v06002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction. <b class=verse-num id=v06002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no spirit left in any man because of you, for the LORD your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. <b class=verse-num id=v06002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father&#8217;s house, and give me a sure sign <b class=verse-num id=v06002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the men said to her, &#8220;Our life for yours even to death! If you do not tell this business of ours, then when the LORD gives us the land we will deal kindly and faithfully with you.&#8221;</p><p id=p06002014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived in the wall. <b class=verse-num id=v06002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And she said to them, &#8220;Go into the hills, or the pursuers will encounter you, and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned. Then afterward you may go your way.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The men said to her, &#8220;We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours that you have made us swear. <b class=verse-num id=v06002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Behold, when we come into the land, you shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father&#8217;s household. <b class=verse-num id=v06002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be guiltless. But if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head. <b class=verse-num id=v06002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath that you have made us swear.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And she said, &#8220;According to your words, so be it.&#8221; Then she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</p><p id=p06002021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned, and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v06002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they told him all that had happened to them. <b class=verse-num id=v06002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they said to Joshua, &#8220;Truly the LORD has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away because of us.&#8221;</p></div>

And they came to the Jordan, he and all the people of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. <b class=verse-num id=v06003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>At the end of three days the officers went through the camp <b class=verse-num id=v06003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and commanded the people, &#8220;As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it. <b class=verse-num id=v06003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits in length. Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said to the people, &#8220;Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to the priests, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people.&#8221; So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</p><p id=p06003006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. <b class=verse-num id=v06003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, &#8216;When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to the people of Israel, &#8220;Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, &#8220;Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. <b class=verse-num id=v06003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v06003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man. <b class=verse-num id=v06003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap.&#8221;</p><p id=p06003013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, <b class=verse-num id=v06003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), <b class=verse-num id=v06003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off.

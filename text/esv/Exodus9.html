They shall be left only in the Nile.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v02008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields. <b class=verse-num id=v02008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. <b class=verse-num id=v02008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.</p><h3 id=p02008015_05-1>The Third Plague: Gnats</h3><p id=p02008015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v02008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast. <b class=verse-num id=v02008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, &#8220;This is the finger of God.&#8221; But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.</p><h3 id=p02008019_09-1>The Fourth Plague: Flies</h3><p id=p02008019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand. <b class=verse-num id=v02008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the LORD did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants&#8217; houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.</p><p id=p02008024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v02008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, &#8220;Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Moses said, &#8220;It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? <b class=verse-num id=v02008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>We must go three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he tells us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Pharaoh said, &#8220;I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Moses said, &#8220;Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained. <b class=verse-num id=v02008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.</p></div>

All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died. <b class=verse-num id=v02009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead.

And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast. <b class=verse-num id=v02009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v02009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had spoken to Moses.</p><h3 id=p02009012_11-1>The Seventh Plague: Hail</h3><p id=p02009012_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v02009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go. <b class=verse-num id=v02009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. <b class=verse-num id=v02009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses, <b class=verse-num id=v02009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.</p><p id=p02009021_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v02009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth.

Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country, <b class=verse-num id=v02010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land.

And he said to them, &#8220;Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, &#8220;The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go!

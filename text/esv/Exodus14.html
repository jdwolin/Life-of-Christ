Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02013002_05-1>The Feast of Unleavened Bread</h3><p id=p02013002_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v02013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then Moses said to the people, &#8220;Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by a strong hand the LORD brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten. <b class=verse-num id=v02013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out. <b class=verse-num id=v02013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this service in this month. <b class=verse-num id=v02013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory. <b class=verse-num id=v02013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>You shall tell your son on that day, &#8216;It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.</p><p id=p02013010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v02013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you, <b class=verse-num id=v02013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be the LORD&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v02013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem. <b class=verse-num id=v02013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when in time to come your son asks you, &#8216;What does this mean?&#8217; you shall say to him, &#8216;By a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery. <b class=verse-num id=v02013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02013016_10-1>Pillars of Cloud and Fire</h3><p id=p02013016_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v02013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, &#8220;Lest the people change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle. <b class=verse-num id=v02013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, &#8220;God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v02013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night. <b class=verse-num id=v02013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.</p></div>

And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They said to Moses, &#8220;Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?

And the Egyptians said, &#8220;Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.&#8221;</p><p id=p02014025_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. <b class=verse-num id=v02014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained. <b class=verse-num id=v02014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</p><p id=p02014029_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. <b class=verse-num id=v02014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.</p></div>

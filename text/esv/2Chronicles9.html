<h3 id=p14009001_01-1>The Queen of Sheba</h3><p id=p14009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind. <b class=verse-num id=v14009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her. <b class=verse-num id=v14009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, <b class=verse-num id=v14009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.</p><p id=p14009004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And she said to the king, &#8220;The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom, <b class=verse-num id=v14009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report that I heard. <b class=verse-num id=v14009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! <b class=verse-num id=v14009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</p><p id=p14009009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones. <b class=verse-num id=v14009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the king made from the algum wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king&#8217;s house, lyres also and harps for the singers. There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.</p><p id=p14009011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.</p><h3 id=p14009012_05-1>Solomon&#8217;s Wealth</h3><p id=p14009012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, <b class=verse-num id=v14009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>besides that which the explorers and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon. <b class=verse-num id=v14009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of beaten gold went into each shield. <b class=verse-num id=v14009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; 300 shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. <b class=verse-num id=v14009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests, <b class=verse-num id=v14009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v14009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>All King Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. <b class=verse-num id=v14009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For the king&#8217;s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</p><p id=p14009021_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. <b class=verse-num id=v14009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. <b class=verse-num id=v14009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. <b class=verse-num id=v14009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v14009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. <b class=verse-num id=v14009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.</p><h3 id=p14009028_07-1>Solomon&#8217;s Death</h3><p id=p14009028_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? <b class=verse-num id=v14009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v14009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14010001_01-1>The Revolt Against Rehoboam</h3><p id=p14010001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <b class=verse-num id=v14010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v14010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam, <b class=verse-num id=v14010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Come to me again in three days.&#8221; So the people went away.</p><p id=p14010005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, &#8220;How do you advise me to answer this people?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. <b class=verse-num id=v14010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, &#8216;Lighten the yoke that your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, &#8220;Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, &#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us&#8217;; thus shall you say to them, &#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s thighs. <b class=verse-num id=v14010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p14010011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, &#8220;Come to me again the third day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men, <b class=verse-num id=v14010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, &#8220;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the LORD might fulfill his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p><p id=p14010015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, &#8220;What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.&#8221; So all Israel went to their tents. <b class=verse-num id=v14010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones.

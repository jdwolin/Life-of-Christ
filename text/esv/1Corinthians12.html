<p id=p46011001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.</p><h3 id=p46011001_01-1>Head Coverings</h3><p id=p46011001_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. <b class=verse-num id=v46011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. <b class=verse-num id=v46011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, <b class=verse-num id=v46011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. <b class=verse-num id=v46011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. <b class=verse-num id=v46011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <b class=verse-num id=v46011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <b class=verse-num id=v46011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; <b class=verse-num id=v46011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. <b class=verse-num id=v46011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? <b class=verse-num id=v46011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, <b class=verse-num id=v46011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. <b class=verse-num id=v46011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p><h3 id=p46011016_03-1>The Lord&#8217;s Supper</h3><p id=p46011016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. <b class=verse-num id=v46011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <b class=verse-num id=v46011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. <b class=verse-num id=v46011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When you come together, it is not the Lord&#8217;s supper that you eat. <b class=verse-num id=v46011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=verse-num id=v46011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p><p id=p46011022_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, <b class=verse-num id=v46011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v46011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v46011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes.</p><p id=p46011026_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. <b class=verse-num id=v46011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. <b class=verse-num id=v46011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. <b class=verse-num id=v46011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. <b class=verse-num id=v46011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p><p id=p46011032_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home&#8212;so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p></div>

If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? <b class=verse-num id=v46012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. <b class=verse-num id=v46012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>If all were a single member, where would the body be? <b class=verse-num id=v46012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</p><p id=p46012020_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The eye cannot say to the hand, &#8220;I have no need of you,&#8221; nor again the head to the feet, &#8220;I have no need of you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <b class=verse-num id=v46012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, <b class=verse-num id=v46012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, <b class=verse-num id=v46012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. <b class=verse-num id=v46012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</p><p id=p46012026_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. <b class=verse-num id=v46012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. <b class=verse-num id=v46012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <b class=verse-num id=v46012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? <b class=verse-num id=v46012031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But earnestly desire the higher gifts.</p><p id=p46012031_08-1>And I will show you a still more excellent way.</p></div>

It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; <b class=verse-num id=v46013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v46013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p><p id=p46013007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. <b class=verse-num id=v46013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <b class=verse-num id=v46013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. <b class=verse-num id=v46013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. <b class=verse-num id=v46013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.

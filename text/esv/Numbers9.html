From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.</p><h3 id=p04008004_04-1>Cleansing of the Levites</h3><p id=p04008004_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v04008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them. <b class=verse-num id=v04008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v04008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering. <b class=verse-num id=v04008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When you bring the Levites before the LORD, the people of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites, <b class=verse-num id=v04008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v04008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD to make atonement for the Levites. <b class=verse-num id=v04008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to the LORD.</p><p id=p04008013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v04008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine. <b class=verse-num id=v04008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a wave offering. <b class=verse-num id=v04008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself. <b class=verse-num id=v04008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself, <b class=verse-num id=v04008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Israel, that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary.&#8221;</p><p id=p04008019_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v04008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites.

Why are we kept from bringing the LORD&#8217;s offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to them, &#8220;Wait, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.&#8221;</p><p id=p04009008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v04009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it.

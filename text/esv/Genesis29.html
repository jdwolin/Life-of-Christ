And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob&#8217;s and Esau&#8217;s mother.</p><h3 id=p01028005_05-1>Esau Marries an Ishmaelite</h3><p id=p01028005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01028006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, &#8220;You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01028007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram. <b class=verse-num id=v01028008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father, <b class=verse-num id=v01028009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham&#8217;s son, the sister of Nebaioth.</p><h3 id=p01028009_09-1>Jacob&#8217;s Dream</h3><p id=p01028009_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01028010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran. <b class=verse-num id=v01028011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. <b class=verse-num id=v01028012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! <b class=verse-num id=v01028013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, &#8220;I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. <b class=verse-num id=v01028014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. <b class=verse-num id=v01028015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01028016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, &#8220;Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01028017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he was afraid and said, &#8220;How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&#8221;</p><p id=p01028017_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v01028018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. <b class=verse-num id=v01028019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. <b class=verse-num id=v01028020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, &#8220;If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, <b class=verse-num id=v01028021-1>21&nbsp;</b>so that I come again to my father&#8217;s house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God, <b class=verse-num id=v01028022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God&#8217;s house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.&#8221;</p></div>

The stone on the well&#8217;s mouth was large, <b class=verse-num id=v01029003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.</p><p id=p01029003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to them, &#8220;My brothers, where do you come from?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We are from Haran.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We know him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Is it well with him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But they said, &#8220;We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.&#8221;</p><p id=p01029008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029009-1>9&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&#8217;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. <b class=verse-num id=v01029010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01029011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <b class=verse-num id=v01029012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#8217;s kinsman, and that he was Rebekah&#8217;s son, and she ran and told her father.</p><p id=p01029012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister&#8217;s son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things, <b class=verse-num id=v01029014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and Laban said to him, &#8220;Surely you are my bone and my flesh!&#8221; And he stayed with him a month.</p><p id=p01029014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. <b class=verse-num id=v01029017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Leah&#8217;s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. <b class=verse-num id=v01029018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, &#8220;I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Laban said, &#8220;It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.</p><p id=p01029020_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast. <b class=verse-num id=v01029023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <b class=verse-num id=v01029024-1>24&nbsp;</b>(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.) <b class=verse-num id=v01029025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Laban said, &#8220;It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. <b class=verse-num id=v01029027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01029029-1>29&nbsp;</b>(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.) <b class=verse-num id=v01029030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.</p><h3 id=p01029030_06-1>Jacob&#8217;s Children</h3><p id=p01029030_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01029031-1>31&nbsp;</b>When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. <b class=verse-num id=v01029032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, &#8220;Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01029033-1>33&nbsp;</b>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also.&#8221; And she called his name Simeon. <b class=verse-num id=v01029034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&#8221; Therefore his name was called Levi. <b class=verse-num id=v01029035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;This time I will praise the LORD.&#8221; Therefore she called his name Judah.

He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban&#8217;s flock. <b class=verse-num id=v01030041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks, <b class=verse-num id=v01030042-1>42&nbsp;</b>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban&#8217;s, and the stronger Jacob&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v01030043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</p></div>

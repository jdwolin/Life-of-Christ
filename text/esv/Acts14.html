And they had John to assist them. <b class=verse-num id=v44013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. <b class=verse-num id=v44013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him <b class=verse-num id=v44013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? <b class=verse-num id=v44013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.&#8221; Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. <b class=verse-num id=v44013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p><h3 id=p44013012_11-1>Paul and Barnabas at Antioch in Pisidia</h3><p id=p44013012_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia.

And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. <b class=verse-num id=v44013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, &#8220;Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:</p><p id=p44013016_18-1>&#8220;Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. <b class=verse-num id=v44013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. <b class=verse-num id=v44013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v44013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. <b class=verse-num id=v44013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v44013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v44013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, &#8216;I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Of this man&#8217;s offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. <b class=verse-num id=v44013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v44013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And as John was finishing his course, he said, &#8216;What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.&#8217;</p><p id=p44013025_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. <b class=verse-num id=v44013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. <b class=verse-num id=v44013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. <b class=verse-num id=v44013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. <b class=verse-num id=v44013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But God raised him from the dead, <b class=verse-num id=v44013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v44013032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v44013033-1>33&nbsp;</b>this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44013033_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;You are my Son,</span><br /><span id=p44013033_18-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today I have begotten you.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44013033_18-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44013034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44013034_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44013034_18-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44013035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Therefore he says also in another psalm,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44013035_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;You will not let your Holy One see corruption.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44013035_18-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44013036-1>36&nbsp;</b>For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, <b class=verse-num id=v44013037-1>37&nbsp;</b>but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. <b class=verse-num id=v44013038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, <b class=verse-num id=v44013039-1>39&nbsp;</b>and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v44013040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44013041_18-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44013041-1>41&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;Look, you scoffers,</span><br /><span id=p44013041_18-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be astounded and perish;</span><br /><span id=p44013041_18-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am doing a work in your days,</span><br /><span id=p44013041_18-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44013041_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44013042-1>42&nbsp;</b>As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v44013043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</p><p id=p44013043_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44013044-1>44&nbsp;</b>The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44013045-1>45&nbsp;</b>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him. <b class=verse-num id=v44013046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, &#8220;It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.

Farewell.&#8221;</p><p id=p44015029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. <b class=verse-num id=v44015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. <b class=verse-num id=v44015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. <b class=verse-num id=v44015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. <b class=verse-num id=v44015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p><h3 id=p44015035_10-1>Paul and Barnabas Separate</h3><p id=p44015035_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &#8220;Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. <b class=verse-num id=v44015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. <b class=verse-num id=v44015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, <b class=verse-num id=v44015040-1>40&nbsp;</b>but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44015041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</p></div>

Amen.</p><p id=p45009005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v45009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but &#8220;Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. <b class=verse-num id=v45009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For this is what the promise said: &#8220;About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, <b class=verse-num id=v45009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad&#8212;in order that God&#8217;s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>she was told, &#8220;The older will serve the younger.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As it is written, &#8220;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&#8221;</p><p id=p45009013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&#8217;s part? By no means! <b class=verse-num id=v45009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For he says to Moses, &#8220;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. <b class=verse-num id=v45009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &#8220;For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.</p><p id=p45009018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You will say to me then, &#8220;Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, &#8220;Why have you made me like this?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? <b class=verse-num id=v45009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, <b class=verse-num id=v45009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? <b class=verse-num id=v45009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>As indeed he says in Hosea,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45009025_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Those who were not my people I will call &#8216;my people,&#8217;</span><br /><span id=p45009025_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her who was not beloved I will call &#8216;beloved.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45009026_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;And in the very place where it was said to them, &#8216;You are not my people,&#8217;</span><br /><span id=p45009026_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there they will be called &#8216;sons of the living God.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45009026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: &#8220;Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved, <b class=verse-num id=v45009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And as Isaiah predicted,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45009029_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring,</span><br /><span id=p45009029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would have been like Sodom</span><br /><span id=p45009029_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and become like Gomorrah.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p45009029_04-1>Israel&#8217;s Unbelief</h3><p id=p45009029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v45009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; <b class=verse-num id=v45009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. <b class=verse-num id=v45009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works.

For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. <b class=verse-num id=v45011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v45011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But what is God&#8217;s reply to him? &#8220;I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. <b class=verse-num id=v45011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</p><p id=p45011006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking.

By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. <b class=verse-num id=v45011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</p><p id=p45011012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles.

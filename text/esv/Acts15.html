And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, <b class=verse-num id=v44014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>said in a loud voice, &#8220;Stand upright on your feet.&#8221; And he sprang up and began walking. <b class=verse-num id=v44014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, &#8220;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. <b class=verse-num id=v44014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v44014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, <b class=verse-num id=v44014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. <b class=verse-num id=v44014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. <b class=verse-num id=v44014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</p><h3 id=p44014018_11-1>Paul Stoned at Lystra</h3><p id=p44014018_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v44014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. <b class=verse-num id=v44014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, <b class=verse-num id=v44014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</p><h3 id=p44014023_15-1>Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch in Syria</h3><p id=p44014023_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v44014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. <b class=verse-num id=v44014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, <b class=verse-num id=v44014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled. <b class=verse-num id=v44014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. <b class=verse-num id=v44014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they remained no little time with the disciples.</p></div>

If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&#8221;</p><p id=p44015029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. <b class=verse-num id=v44015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. <b class=verse-num id=v44015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. <b class=verse-num id=v44015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. <b class=verse-num id=v44015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p><h3 id=p44015035_10-1>Paul and Barnabas Separate</h3><p id=p44015035_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &#8220;Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. <b class=verse-num id=v44015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. <b class=verse-num id=v44015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other.

A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v44016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. <b class=verse-num id=v44016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v44016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.</p><h3 id=p44016005_06-1>The Macedonian Call</h3><p id=p44016005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. <b class=verse-num id=v44016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. <b class=verse-num id=v44016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. <b class=verse-num id=v44016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, &#8220;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p><h3 id=p44016010_09-1>The Conversion of Lydia</h3><p id=p44016010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, <b class=verse-num id=v44016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. <b class=verse-num id=v44016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. <b class=verse-num id=v44016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God.

And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&#8217;s bonds were unfastened. <b class=verse-num id=v44016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v44016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But Paul cried with a loud voice, &#8220;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. <b class=verse-num id=v44016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he brought them out and said, &#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. <b class=verse-num id=v44016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. <b class=verse-num id=v44016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.</p><p id=p44016034_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, &#8220;Let those men go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &#8220;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But Paul said to them, &#8220;They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. <b class=verse-num id=v44016039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. <b class=verse-num id=v44016040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.</p></div>

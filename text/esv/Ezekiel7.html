<h3 id=p26006001_01-1>Judgment Against Idolatry</h3><p id=p26006001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, <b class=verse-num id=v26006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. <b class=verse-num id=v26006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols. <b class=verse-num id=v26006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. <b class=verse-num id=v26006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out. <b class=verse-num id=v26006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD.</p><p id=p26006007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries, <b class=verse-num id=v26006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken over their whoring heart that has departed from me and over their eyes that go whoring after their idols. And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they shall know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.&#8221;</p><p id=p26006010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. <b class=verse-num id=v26006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v26006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols. <b class=verse-num id=v26006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and waste, in all their dwelling places, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

The end has come upon the four corners of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v26007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</p><p id=p26007004_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes. <b class=verse-num id=v26007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes. <b class=verse-num id=v26007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains. <b class=verse-num id=v26007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.</p><p id=p26007009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded. <b class=verse-num id=v26007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. <b class=verse-num id=v26007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v26007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life.</p><p id=p26007013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude. <b class=verse-num id=v26007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour. <b class=verse-num id=v26007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity. <b class=verse-num id=v26007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water. <b class=verse-num id=v26007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. <b class=verse-num id=v26007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity. <b class=verse-num id=v26007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them. <b class=verse-num id=v26007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it. <b class=verse-num id=v26007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it.</p><p id=p26007022_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v26007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Forge a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. <b class=verse-num id=v26007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned. <b class=verse-num id=v26007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none. <b class=verse-num id=v26007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders. <b class=verse-num id=v26007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p26008001_01-1>Abominations in the Temple</h3><p id=p26008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there. <b class=verse-num id=v26008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then I looked, and behold, a form that had the appearance of a man. Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal. <b class=verse-num id=v26008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. <b class=verse-num id=v26008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.</p><p id=p26008004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.&#8221; So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy. <b class=verse-num id=v26008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.&#8221;</p><p id=p26008006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall. <b class=verse-num id=v26008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, dig in the wall.&#8221; So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance. <b class=verse-num id=v26008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So I went in and saw. And there, engraved on the wall all around, was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up. <b class=verse-num id=v26008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, &#8216;The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He said also to me, &#8220;You will see still greater abominations that they commit.&#8221;</p><p id=p26008013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. <b class=verse-num id=v26008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these.&#8221;</p><p id=p26008015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east. <b class=verse-num id=v26008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose. <b class=verse-num id=v26008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.&#8221;</p></div>

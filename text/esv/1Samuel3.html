And the boy was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest.</p><h3 id=p09002011_03-1>Eli&#8217;s Worthless Sons</h3><p id=p09002011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&#8217;s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, <b class=verse-num id=v09002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. <b class=verse-num id=v09002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest&#8217;s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, &#8220;Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And if the man said to him, &#8220;Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.</p><p id=p09002017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v09002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <b class=verse-num id=v09002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &#8220;May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD.&#8221; So then they would return to their home.</p><p id=p09002020_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters.

For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people. <b class=verse-num id=v09002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad. <b class=verse-num id=v09002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?&#8221; But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.</p><p id=p09002025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.</p><h3 id=p09002026_10-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Rejects Eli&#8217;s Household</h3><p id=p09002026_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v09002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh? <b class=verse-num id=v09002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v09002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: &#8216;I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,&#8217; but now the LORD declares: &#8216;Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <b class=verse-num id=v09002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father&#8217;s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. <b class=verse-num id=v09002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever. <b class=verse-num id=v09002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men. <b class=verse-num id=v09002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day. <b class=verse-num id=v09002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever. <b class=verse-num id=v09002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, &#8220;Please put me in one of the priests&#8217; places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09003001_01-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Calls Samuel</h3><p id=p09003001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</p><p id=p09003001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place. <b class=verse-num id=v09003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</p><p id=p09003003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and ran to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;I did not call; lie down again.&#8221; So he went and lay down.</p><p id=p09003005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the LORD called again, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221; and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;I did not call, my son; lie down again.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</p><p id=p09003007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221; Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy. <b class=verse-num id=v09003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, &#8220;Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, &#8216;Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.&#8217;&#8221; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p><p id=p09003009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD came and stood, calling as at other times, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221; And Samuel said, &#8220;Speak, for your servant hears.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. <b class=verse-num id=v09003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. <b class=verse-num id=v09003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them. <b class=verse-num id=v09003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&#8217;s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.&#8221;</p><p id=p09003014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. <b class=verse-num id=v09003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Eli called Samuel and said, &#8220;Samuel, my son.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Eli said, &#8220;What was it that he told you?

They encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. <b class=verse-num id=v09004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle. <b class=verse-num id=v09004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And when the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, &#8220;Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p><p id=p09004004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded. <b class=verse-num id=v09004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, &#8220;What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?&#8221; And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp, <b class=verse-num id=v09004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>the Philistines were afraid, for they said, &#8220;A god has come into the camp.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. <b class=verse-num id=v09004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v09004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.&#8221;</p><p id=p09004009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. <b class=verse-num id=v09004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</p><h3 id=p09004011_06-1>The Death of Eli</h3><p id=p09004011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. <b class=verse-num id=v09004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out. <b class=verse-num id=v09004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, &#8220;What is this uproar?&#8221; Then the man hurried and came and told Eli. <b class=verse-num id=v09004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see. <b class=verse-num id=v09004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the man said to Eli, &#8220;I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;How did it go, my son?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He who brought the news answered and said, &#8220;Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people.

And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.</p><p id=p44008013_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, <b class=verse-num id=v44008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <b class=verse-num id=v44008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v44008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands, he offered them money, <b class=verse-num id=v44008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But Peter said to him, &#8220;May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! <b class=verse-num id=v44008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. <b class=verse-num id=v44008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. <b class=verse-num id=v44008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Simon answered, &#8220;Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.&#8221;</p><p id=p44008024_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</p><h3 id=p44008025_14-1>Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch</h3><p id=p44008025_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v44008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, &#8220;Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.&#8221; This is a desert place. <b class=verse-num id=v44008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship <b class=verse-num id=v44008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. <b class=verse-num id=v44008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit said to Philip, &#8220;Go over and join this chariot.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, &#8220;Do you understand what you are reading?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;How can I, unless someone guides me?&#8221; And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44008032_19-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter</span><br /><span id=p44008032_19-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,</span><br /><span id=p44008032_19-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he opens not his mouth.</span><br /><span id=p44008033_19-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In his humiliation justice was denied him.</span><br /><span id=p44008033_19-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can describe his generation?</span><br /><span id=p44008033_19-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;For his life is taken away from the earth.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44008033_19-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And the eunuch said to Philip, &#8220;About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44008035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44008036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, &#8220;See, here is water!

So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</p><p id=p44009009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, <span class=woc>&#8220;Ananias.&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;Here I am, Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Ananias answered, &#8220;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the Lord said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v44009016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v44009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, &#8220;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized; <b class=verse-num id=v44009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and taking food, he was strengthened.</p><h3 id=p44009019_05-1>Saul Proclaims Jesus in Synagogues</h3><p id=p44009019_10-1>For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &#8220;He is the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And all who heard him were amazed and said, &#8220;Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name?

They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him, <b class=verse-num id=v44009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</p><h3 id=p44009025_14-1>Saul in Jerusalem</h3><p id=p44009025_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. <b class=verse-num id=v44009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him. <b class=verse-num id=v44009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</p><p id=p44009030_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.</p><h3 id=p44009031_17-1>The Healing of Aeneas</h3><p id=p44009031_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. <b class=verse-num id=v44009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed. <b class=verse-num id=v44009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to him, &#8220;Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.&#8221; And immediately he rose. <b class=verse-num id=v44009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</p><h3 id=p44009035_21-1>Dorcas Restored to Life</h3><p id=p44009035_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v44009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity. <b class=verse-num id=v44009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. <b class=verse-num id=v44009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, &#8220;Please come to us without delay.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44009039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. <b class=verse-num id=v44009040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, &#8220;Tabitha, arise.&#8221; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. <b class=verse-num id=v44009041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then, calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. <b class=verse-num id=v44009042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44009043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.</p></div>

What is the reason for your coming?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So he invited them in to be his guests.</p><p id=p44010023_06-1>The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And on the following day they entered Caesarea.

I ask then why you sent for me.&#8221;</p><p id=p44010029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Cornelius said, &#8220;Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing <b class=verse-num id=v44010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8216;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. <b class=verse-num id=v44010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44010033_06-1>Gentiles Hear the Good News</h3><p id=p44010033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So Peter opened his mouth and said: &#8220;Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, <b class=verse-num id=v44010035-1>35&nbsp;</b>but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), <b class=verse-num id=v44010037-1>37&nbsp;</b>you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: <b class=verse-num id=v44010038-1>38&nbsp;</b>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44010039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, <b class=verse-num id=v44010040-1>40&nbsp;</b>but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, <b class=verse-num id=v44010041-1>41&nbsp;</b>not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44010042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44010043-1>43&nbsp;</b>To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44010043_11-1>The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles</h3><p id=p44010043_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44010044-1>44&nbsp;</b>While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. <b class=verse-num id=v44010045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. <b class=verse-num id=v44010046-1>46&nbsp;</b>For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, <b class=verse-num id=v44010047-1>47&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44010048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.</p></div>

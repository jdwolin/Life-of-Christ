<h3 id=p45012001_01-1>A Living Sacrifice</h3><p id=p45012001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. <b class=verse-num id=v45012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</p><h3 id=p45012002_04-1>Gifts of Grace</h3><p id=p45012002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v45012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. <b class=verse-num id=v45012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, <b class=verse-num id=v45012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. <b class=verse-num id=v45012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; <b class=verse-num id=v45012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; <b class=verse-num id=v45012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.</p><h3 id=p45012008_07-1>Marks of the True Christian</h3><p id=p45012008_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. <b class=verse-num id=v45012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. <b class=verse-num id=v45012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v45012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. <b class=verse-num id=v45012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.</p><p id=p45012013_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. <b class=verse-num id=v45012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. <b class=verse-num id=v45012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. <b class=verse-num id=v45012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. <b class=verse-num id=v45012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. <b class=verse-num id=v45012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, &#8220;Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>To the contrary, &#8220;if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45013001_01-1>Submission to the Authorities</h3><p id=p45013001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. <b class=verse-num id=v45013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v45013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, <b class=verse-num id=v45013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for he is God&#8217;s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God&#8217;s wrath on the wrongdoer. <b class=verse-num id=v45013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God&#8217;s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. <b class=verse-num id=v45013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. <b class=verse-num id=v45013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</p><h3 id=p45013007_05-1>Fulfilling the Law Through Love</h3><p id=p45013007_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For the commandments, &#8220;You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,&#8221; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</p><p id=p45013010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. <b class=verse-num id=v45013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. <b class=verse-num id=v45013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. <b class=verse-num id=v45013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45014001_01-1>Do Not Pass Judgment on One Another</h3><p id=p45014001_08-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. <b class=verse-num id=v45014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. <b class=verse-num id=v45014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. <b class=verse-num id=v45014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</p><p id=p45014004_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <b class=verse-num id=v45014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. <b class=verse-num id=v45014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. <b class=verse-num id=v45014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v45014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</p><p id=p45014009_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother?

By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. <b class=verse-num id=v45014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. <b class=verse-num id=v45014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v45014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. <b class=verse-num id=v45014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.</p><p id=p45014019_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v45014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. <b class=verse-num id=v45014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. <b class=verse-num id=v45014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. <b class=verse-num id=v45014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.</p></div>

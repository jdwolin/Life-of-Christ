<h3 id=p48004001_01-1>Sons and Heirs</h3><p id=p48004001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, <b class=verse-num id=v48004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. <b class=verse-num id=v48004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. <b class=verse-num id=v48004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, <b class=verse-num id=v48004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. <b class=verse-num id=v48004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &#8220;Abba! Father!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.</p><h3 id=p48004007_04-1>Paul&#8217;s Concern for the Galatians</h3><p id=p48004007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v48004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? <b class=verse-num id=v48004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You observe days and months and seasons and years! <b class=verse-num id=v48004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.</p><p id=p48004011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong. <b class=verse-num id=v48004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first, <b class=verse-num id=v48004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v48004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me. <b class=verse-num id=v48004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? <b class=verse-num id=v48004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. <b class=verse-num id=v48004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, <b class=verse-num id=v48004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you! <b class=verse-num id=v48004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</p><h3 id=p48004020_09-1>Example of Hagar and Sarah</h3><p id=p48004020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v48004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? <b class=verse-num id=v48004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. <b class=verse-num id=v48004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. <b class=verse-num id=v48004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. <b class=verse-num id=v48004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. <b class=verse-num id=v48004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. <b class=verse-num id=v48004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear;</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor!</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the children of the desolate one will be more</span><br /><span id=p48004027_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than those of the one who has a husband.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p48004027_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v48004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <b class=verse-num id=v48004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. <b class=verse-num id=v48004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But what does the Scripture say? &#8220;Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.</p></div>

<h3 id=p48005001_01-1>Christ Has Set Us Free</h3><p id=p48005001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p><p id=p48005001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. <b class=verse-num id=v48005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. <b class=verse-num id=v48005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v48005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.</p><p id=p48005006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? <b class=verse-num id=v48005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>This persuasion is not from him who calls you. <b class=verse-num id=v48005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. <b class=verse-num id=v48005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. <b class=verse-num id=v48005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. <b class=verse-num id=v48005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!</p><p id=p48005012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. <b class=verse-num id=v48005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</p><h3 id=p48005015_06-1>Keep in Step with the Spirit</h3><p id=p48005015_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v48005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. <b class=verse-num id=v48005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, <b class=verse-num id=v48005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, <b class=verse-num id=v48005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v48005022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <b class=verse-num id=v48005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. <b class=verse-num id=v48005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</p><p id=p48005024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v48005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</p></div>

Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. <b class=verse-num id=v48006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. <b class=verse-num id=v48006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. <b class=verse-num id=v48006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For each will have to bear his own load.</p><p id=p48006005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v48006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches. <b class=verse-num id=v48006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. <b class=verse-num id=v48006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. <b class=verse-num id=v48006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. <b class=verse-num id=v48006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p><h3 id=p48006010_05-1>Final Warning and Benediction</h3><p id=p48006010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. <b class=verse-num id=v48006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. <b class=verse-num id=v48006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. <b class=verse-num id=v48006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. <b class=verse-num id=v48006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</p><p id=p48006016_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</p><p id=p48006017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.

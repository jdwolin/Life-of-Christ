For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For who knows a person&#8217;s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. <b class=verse-num id=v46002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.</p><p id=p46002013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v46002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. <b class=verse-num id=v46002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. <b class=verse-num id=v46002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?&#8221; But we have the mind of Christ.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46003001_01-1>Divisions in the Church</h3><p id=p46003001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, <b class=verse-num id=v46003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way? <b class=verse-num id=v46003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For when one says, &#8220;I follow Paul,&#8221; and another, &#8220;I follow Apollos,&#8221; are you not being merely human?</p><p id=p46003004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. <b class=verse-num id=v46003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. <b class=verse-num id=v46003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. <b class=verse-num id=v46003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. <b class=verse-num id=v46003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers. You are God&#8217;s field, God&#8217;s building.</p><p id=p46003009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it. <b class=verse-num id=v46003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>each one&#8217;s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. <b class=verse-num id=v46003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. <b class=verse-num id=v46003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>If anyone&#8217;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</p><p id=p46003015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that you are God&#8217;s temple and that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in you? <b class=verse-num id=v46003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>If anyone destroys God&#8217;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&#8217;s temple is holy, and you are that temple.</p><p id=p46003017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. <b class=verse-num id=v46003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, &#8220;He catches the wise in their craftiness,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and again, &#8220;The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, <b class=verse-num id=v46003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future&#8212;all are yours, <b class=verse-num id=v46003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and you are Christ&#8217;s, and Christ is God&#8217;s.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46004001_01-1>The Ministry of Apostles</h3><p id=p46004001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. <b class=verse-num id=v46004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. <b class=verse-num id=v46004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. <b class=verse-num id=v46004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.</p><p id=p46004005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another. <b class=verse-num id=v46004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?</p><p id=p46004007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you! <b class=verse-num id=v46004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. <b class=verse-num id=v46004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>We are fools for Christ&#8217;s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. <b class=verse-num id=v46004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, <b class=verse-num id=v46004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; <b class=verse-num id=v46004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.</p><p id=p46004013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. <b class=verse-num id=v46004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. <b class=verse-num id=v46004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I urge you, then, be imitators of me. <b class=verse-num id=v46004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. <b class=verse-num id=v46004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. <b class=verse-num id=v46004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power. <b class=verse-num id=v46004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. <b class=verse-num id=v46004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?</p></div>

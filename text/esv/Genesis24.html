For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.&#8221;</p><p id=p01023009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city, <b class=verse-num id=v01023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, &#8220;But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field.

She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. <b class=verse-num id=v01024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then the servant ran to meet her and said, &#8220;Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>She said, &#8220;Drink, my lord.&#8221; And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink. <b class=verse-num id=v01024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, &#8220;I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels. <b class=verse-num id=v01024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.</p><p id=p01024021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels, <b class=verse-num id=v01024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;Please tell me whose daughter you are.

And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. <b class=verse-num id=v01024031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01024033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, &#8220;I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Speak on.&#8221;</p><p id=p01024033_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01024034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So he said, &#8220;I am Abraham&#8217;s servant. <b class=verse-num id=v01024035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v01024036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And Sarah my master&#8217;s wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has. <b class=verse-num id=v01024037-1>37&nbsp;</b>My master made me swear, saying, &#8216;You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell, <b class=verse-num id=v01024038-1>38&nbsp;</b>but you shall go to my father&#8217;s house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01024039-1>39&nbsp;</b>I said to my master, &#8216;Perhaps the woman will not follow me.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01024040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But he said to me, &#8216;The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01024041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.&#8217;</p><p id=p01024041_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01024042-1>42&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I came today to the spring and said, &#8216;O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go, <b class=verse-num id=v01024043-1>43&nbsp;</b>behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, &#8220;Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024044-1>44&nbsp;</b>and who will say to me, &#8220;Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,&#8221; let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master&#8217;s son.&#8217;</p><p id=p01024044_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01024045-1>45&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, &#8216;Please let me drink.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01024046-1>46&nbsp;</b>She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, &#8216;Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.&#8217; So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also. <b class=verse-num id=v01024047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Then I asked her, &#8216;Whose daughter are you?&#8217; She said, &#8216;The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&#8217;s son, whom Milcah bore to him.&#8217; So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms. <b class=verse-num id=v01024048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master&#8217;s kinsman for his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01024049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.&#8221;</p><p id=p01024049_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01024050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, &#8220;The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot speak to you bad or good. <b class=verse-num id=v01024051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master&#8217;s son, as the LORD has spoken.&#8221;</p><p id=p01024051_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01024052-1>52&nbsp;</b>When Abraham&#8217;s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v01024053-1>53&nbsp;</b>And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments. <b class=verse-num id=v01024054-1>54&nbsp;</b>And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, &#8220;Send me away to my master.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024055-1>55&nbsp;</b>Her brother and her mother said, &#8220;Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024056-1>56&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, &#8220;Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way.

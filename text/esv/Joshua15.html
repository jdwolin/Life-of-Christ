<h3 id=p06014001_01-1>The Inheritance West of the Jordan</h3><p id=p06014001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers&#8217; houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit. <b class=verse-num id=v06014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Their inheritance was by lot, just as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes. <b class=verse-num id=v06014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. <b class=verse-num id=v06014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance. <b class=verse-num id=v06014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land.</p><h3 id=p06014005_07-1>Caleb&#8217;s Request and Inheritance</h3><p id=p06014005_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v06014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, &#8220;You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. <b class=verse-num id=v06014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. <b class=verse-num id=v06014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God. <b class=verse-num id=v06014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Moses swore on that day, saying, &#8216;Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. <b class=verse-num id=v06014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming. <b class=verse-num id=v06014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said.&#8221;</p><p id=p06014012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v06014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. <b class=verse-num id=v06014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war.</p></div>

This shall be your south boundary. <b class=verse-num id=v06015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the east boundary is the Salt Sea, to the mouth of the Jordan. And the boundary on the north side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v06015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the boundary goes up to Beth-hoglah and passes along north of Beth-arabah. And the boundary goes up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. <b class=verse-num id=v06015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the boundary goes up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. And the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh and ends at En-rogel. <b class=verse-num id=v06015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary goes up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem). And the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. <b class=verse-num id=v06015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron. Then the boundary bends around to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). <b class=verse-num id=v06015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to Beth-shemesh and passes along by Timnah. <b class=verse-num id=v06015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The boundary goes out to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron, then the boundary bends around to Shikkeron and passes along to Mount Baalah and goes out to Jabneel. Then the boundary comes to an end at the sea. <b class=verse-num id=v06015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans.</p><p id=p06015012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>According to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak). <b class=verse-num id=v06015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak. <b class=verse-num id=v06015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. <b class=verse-num id=v06015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Caleb said, &#8220;Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. <b class=verse-num id=v06015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field.

So, if you seek me, let these men go.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <span class=woc>&#8220;Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&#8217;s servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant&#8217;s name was Malchus.) <b class=verse-num id=v43018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to Peter, <span class=woc>&#8220;Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43018011_06-1>Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas</h3><p id=p43018011_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. <b class=verse-num id=v43018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. <b class=verse-num id=v43018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</p><h3 id=p43018014_11-1>Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id=p43018014_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, <b class=verse-num id=v43018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. <b class=verse-num id=v43018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The servant girl at the door said to Peter, &#8220;You also are not one of this man&#8217;s disciples, are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves.

I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43018021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, &#8220;Is that how you answer the high priest?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p><h3 id=p43018024_19-1>Peter Denies Jesus Again</h3><p id=p43018024_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, &#8220;You also are not one of his disciples, are you?&#8221; He denied it and said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &#8220;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.</p><h3 id=p43018027_23-1>Jesus Before Pilate</h3><p id=p43018027_26-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor&#8217;s headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor&#8217;s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. <b class=verse-num id=v43018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So Pilate went outside to them and said, &#8220;What accusation do you bring against this man?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&#8221; The Jews said to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.</p><h3 id=p43018032_26-1>My Kingdom Is Not of This World</h3><p id=p43018032_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v43018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Pilate answered, &#8220;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;So you are a king?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world&#8212;to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43018038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to him, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221;</p><p id=p43018038_33-1>After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, &#8220;I find no guilt in him. <b class=verse-num id=v43018039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43018040-1>40&nbsp;</b>They cried out again, &#8220;Not this man, but Barabbas!&#8221; Now Barabbas was a robber.</p></div>

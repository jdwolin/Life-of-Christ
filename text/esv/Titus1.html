He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, <b class=verse-num id=v56001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. <b class=verse-num id=v56001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.</p><p id=p56001009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v56001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party. <b class=verse-num id=v56001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. <b class=verse-num id=v56001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, &#8220;Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v56001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, <b class=verse-num id=v56001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v56001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. <b class=verse-num id=v56001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.</p></div>

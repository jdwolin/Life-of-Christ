And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance. <b class=verse-num id=v06014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land.</p><h3 id=p06014005_07-1>Caleb&#8217;s Request and Inheritance</h3><p id=p06014005_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v06014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, &#8220;You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. <b class=verse-num id=v06014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. <b class=verse-num id=v06014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God. <b class=verse-num id=v06014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Moses swore on that day, saying, &#8216;Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. <b class=verse-num id=v06014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming. <b class=verse-num id=v06014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities.

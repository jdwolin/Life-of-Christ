<h3 id=p09022001_01-1>David at the Cave of Adullam</h3><p id=p09022001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father&#8217;s house heard it, they went down there to him. <b class=verse-num id=v09022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.</p><p id=p09022002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, &#8220;Please let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. <b class=verse-num id=v09022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the prophet Gad said to David, &#8220;Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.&#8221; So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.</p><h3 id=p09022005_07-1>Saul Kills the Priests at Nob</h3><p id=p09022005_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. <b class=verse-num id=v09022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, &#8220;Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, <b class=verse-num id=v09022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, &#8220;I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, <b class=verse-num id=v09022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.&#8221;</p><p id=p09022010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&#8217;s house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king. <b class=verse-num id=v09022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;Hear now, son of Ahitub.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Here I am, my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimelech answered the king, &#8220;And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king&#8217;s son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house? <b class=verse-num id=v09022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the guard who stood about him, &#8220;Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.&#8221; But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Doeg, &#8220;You turn and strike the priests.&#8221; And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v09022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.</p><p id=p09022019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v09022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. <b class=verse-num id=v09022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v09022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abiathar, &#8220;I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v09022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. With me you shall be in safekeeping.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09023001_01-1>David Saves the City of Keilah</h3><p id=p09023001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09023001-1>23:1&nbsp;</b>Now they told David, &#8220;Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Therefore David inquired of the LORD, &#8220;Shall I go and attack these Philistines?&#8221; And the LORD said to David, &#8220;Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But David&#8217;s men said to him, &#8220;Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then David inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him, &#8220;Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p><p id=p09023005_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, &#8220;God has given him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. <b class=verse-num id=v09023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him. And he said to Abiathar the priest, &#8220;Bring the ephod here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then David said, &#8220;O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account. <b class=verse-num id=v09023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell your servant.&#8221; And the LORD said, &#8220;He will come down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then David said, &#8220;Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?&#8221; And the LORD said, &#8220;They will surrender you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition. <b class=verse-num id=v09023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.</p><h3 id=p09023014_07-1>Saul Pursues David</h3><p id=p09023014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. <b class=verse-num id=v09023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan, Saul&#8217;s son, rose and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God. <b class=verse-num id=v09023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul my father also knows this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.</p><p id=p09023018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v09023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &#8220;Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon? <b class=verse-num id=v09023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now come down, O king, according to all your heart&#8217;s desire to come down, and our part shall be to surrender him into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, &#8220;May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me. <b class=verse-num id=v09023022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Go, make yet more sure. Know and see the place where his foot is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he is very cunning. <b class=verse-num id=v09023023-1>23&nbsp;</b>See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul.</p><p id=p09023024_10-1>Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. <b class=verse-num id=v09023025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told, so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. <b class=verse-num id=v09023026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them, <b class=verse-num id=v09023027-1>27&nbsp;</b>a messenger came to Saul, saying, &#8220;Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid against the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09023028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape. <b class=verse-num id=v09023029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of Engedi.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09024001_01-1>David Spares Saul&#8217;s Life</h3><p id=p09024001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, &#8220;Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats&#8217; Rocks. <b class=verse-num id=v09024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. <b class=verse-num id=v09024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the men of David said to him, &#8220;Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, &#8216;Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.&#8217;&#8221; Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe. <b class=verse-num id=v09024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And afterward David&#8217;s heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe. <b class=verse-num id=v09024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said to his men, &#8220;The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD&#8217;s anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.</p><p id=p09024007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221; And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage. <b class=verse-num id=v09024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Why do you listen to the words of men who say, &#8216;Behold, David seeks your harm&#8217;? <b class=verse-num id=v09024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, &#8216;I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it. <b class=verse-num id=v09024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you. <b class=verse-num id=v09024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As the proverb of the ancients says, &#8216;Out of the wicked comes wickedness.&#8217; But my hand shall not be against you. <b class=verse-num id=v09024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea! <b class=verse-num id=v09024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p09024015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, &#8220;Is this your voice, my son David?&#8221; And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. <b class=verse-num id=v09024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He said to David, &#8220;You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil. <b class=verse-num id=v09024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands. <b class=verse-num id=v09024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day. <b class=verse-num id=v09024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Swear to me therefore by the LORD that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46007001_01-1>Principles for Marriage</h3><p id=p46007001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: &#8220;It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. <b class=verse-num id=v46007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v46007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. <b class=verse-num id=v46007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p><p id=p46007005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. <b class=verse-num id=v46007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.</p><p id=p46007007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am. <b class=verse-num id=v46007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p><p id=p46007009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband <b class=verse-num id=v46007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>(but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.</p><p id=p46007011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. <b class=verse-num id=v46007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. <b class=verse-num id=v46007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <b class=verse-num id=v46007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. <b class=verse-num id=v46007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</p><h3 id=p46007016_04-1>Live as You Are Called</h3><p id=p46007016_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches. <b class=verse-num id=v46007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. <b class=verse-num id=v46007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called. <b class=verse-num id=v46007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.) <b class=verse-num id=v46007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a bondservant of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. <b class=verse-num id=v46007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.</p><h3 id=p46007024_09-1>The Unmarried and the Widowed</h3><p id=p46007024_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord&#8217;s mercy is trustworthy. <b class=verse-num id=v46007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. <b class=verse-num id=v46007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <b class=verse-num id=v46007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <b class=verse-num id=v46007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <b class=verse-num id=v46007030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <b class=verse-num id=v46007031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p><p id=p46007031_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007032-1>32&nbsp;</b>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46007033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <b class=verse-num id=v46007034-1>34&nbsp;</b>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v46007035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p><p id=p46007035_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007036-1>36&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry&#8212;it is no sin. <b class=verse-num id=v46007037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <b class=verse-num id=v46007038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p><p id=p46007038_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v46007039-1>39&nbsp;</b>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v46007040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46008001_01-1>Food Offered to Idols</h3><p id=p46008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that &#8220;all of us possess knowledge.&#8221; This &#8220;knowledge&#8221; puffs up, but love builds up. <b class=verse-num id=v46008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. <b class=verse-num id=v46008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.</p><p id=p46008003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that &#8220;an idol has no real existence,&#8221; and that &#8220;there is no God but one.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth&#8212;as indeed there are many &#8220;gods&#8221; and many &#8220;lords&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</p><p id=p46008006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <b class=verse-num id=v46008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. <b class=verse-num id=v46008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. <b class=verse-num id=v46008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol&#8217;s temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? <b class=verse-num id=v46008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. <b class=verse-num id=v46008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.</p></div>

<h3 id=p46009001_01-1>Paul Surrenders His Rights</h3><p id=p46009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord? <b class=verse-num id=v46009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</p><p id=p46009002_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>This is my defense to those who would examine me. <b class=verse-num id=v46009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Do we not have the right to eat and drink? <b class=verse-num id=v46009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? <b class=verse-num id=v46009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? <b class=verse-num id=v46009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?</p><p id=p46009007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same? <b class=verse-num id=v46009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For it is written in the Law of Moses, &#8220;You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.&#8221; Is it for oxen that God is concerned? <b class=verse-num id=v46009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop. <b class=verse-num id=v46009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you? <b class=verse-num id=v46009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more?</p><p id=p46009012_05-1>Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v46009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings? <b class=verse-num id=v46009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.</p><p id=p46009014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting. <b class=verse-num id=v46009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! <b class=verse-num id=v46009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship. <b class=verse-num id=v46009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.</p><p id=p46009018_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. <b class=verse-num id=v46009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. <b class=verse-num id=v46009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. <b class=verse-num id=v46009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. <b class=verse-num id=v46009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.</p><p id=p46009023_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. <b class=verse-num id=v46009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. <b class=verse-num id=v46009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. <b class=verse-num id=v46009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.</p></div>

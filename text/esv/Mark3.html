<h3 id=p41002001_01-1>Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h3><p id=p41002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v41002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. <b class=verse-num id=v41002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. <b class=verse-num id=v41002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. <b class=verse-num id=v41002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. <b class=verse-num id=v41002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span class=woc>&#8220;Son, your sins are forgiven.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, <b class=verse-num id=v41002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise, take up your bed and walk&#8217;?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;he said to the paralytic&#8212;<b class=verse-num woc id=v41002011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, &#8220;We never saw anything like this!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p41002012_05-1>Jesus Calls Levi</h3><p id=p41002012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. <b class=verse-num id=v41002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> And he rose and followed him.</p><p id=p41002014_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. <b class=verse-num id=v41002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, &#8220;Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41002017_08-1>A Question About Fasting</h3><p id=p41002017_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now John&#8217;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, &#8220;Why do John&#8217;s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins&#8212;and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41002022_12-1>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</h3><p id=p41002022_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v41002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. <b class=verse-num id=v41002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the Pharisees were saying to him, &#8220;Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41002028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p></div>

Behold, a sower went out to sow.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41004004-1>4&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41004005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41004006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41004007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41004008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41004009_06-1>The Purpose of the Parables</h3><p id=p41004009_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v41004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. <b class=verse-num id=v41004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41004012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>so that</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p41004012_11-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;they may indeed see but not perceive,</span><br /><span id=p41004012_11-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may indeed hear but not understand,</span><br /><span id=p41004012_11-1 class=line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;lest they should turn and be forgiven.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></span></p><p id=p41004012_11-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v41004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you not understand this parable?

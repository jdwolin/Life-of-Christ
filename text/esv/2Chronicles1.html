<h3 id=p14001001_01-1>Solomon Worships at Gibeon</h3><p id=p14001001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</p><p id=p14001001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers&#8217; houses. <b class=verse-num id=v14001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there. <b class=verse-num id=v14001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>(But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.) <b class=verse-num id=v14001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Moreover, the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly sought it out. <b class=verse-num id=v14001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</p><h3 id=p14001006_05-1>Solomon Prays for Wisdom</h3><p id=p14001006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, &#8220;Ask what I shall give you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Solomon said to God, &#8220;You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and have made me king in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v14001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>O LORD God, let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v14001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>God answered Solomon, &#8220;Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king, <b class=verse-num id=v14001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.</p><h3 id=p14001013_09-1>Solomon Given Wealth</h3><p id=p14001013_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. <b class=verse-num id=v14001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Solomon&#8217;s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king&#8217;s traders would buy them from Kue for a price. <b class=verse-num id=v14001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150. Likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</p></div>

Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him? <b class=verse-num id=v14002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. <b class=verse-num id=v14002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon.

He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father. <b class=verse-num id=v14002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v14002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.&#8221;</p><p id=p14002016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600. <b class=verse-num id=v14002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work.</p></div>

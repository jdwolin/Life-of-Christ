As I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me. <b class=verse-num id=v27004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. <b class=verse-num id=v27004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>At last Daniel came in before me&#8212;he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods&#8212;and I told him the dream, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v27004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too difficult for you, tell me the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v27004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. <b class=verse-num id=v27004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth. <b class=verse-num id=v27004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</p><p id=p27004012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v27004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v27004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He proclaimed aloud and said thus: &#8216;Chop down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches. <b class=verse-num id=v27004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v27004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Let his mind be changed from a man&#8217;s, and let a beast&#8217;s mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him. <b class=verse-num id=v27004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v27004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw.

The king answered and said, &#8220;Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.&#8221; Belteshazzar answered and said, &#8220;My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies! <b class=verse-num id=v27004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth, <b class=verse-num id=v27004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v27004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v27004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, &#8216;Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v27004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king, <b class=verse-num id=v27004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will. <b class=verse-num id=v27004026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules. <b class=verse-num id=v27004027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p27004027_12-1>Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s Humiliation</h3><p id=p27004027_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27004028-1>28&nbsp;</b>All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. <b class=verse-num id=v27004029-1>29&nbsp;</b>At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, <b class=verse-num id=v27004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and the king answered and said, &#8220;Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>While the words were still in the king&#8217;s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, &#8220;O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, <b class=verse-num id=v27004032-1>32&nbsp;</b>and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27004033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles&#8217; feathers, and his nails were like birds&#8217; claws.</p><h3 id=p27004033_14-1>Nebuchadnezzar Restored</h3><p id=p27004033_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v27004034-1>34&nbsp;</b>At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p27004034_16-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,</span><br /><span id=p27004034_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v27004035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he does according to his will among the host of heaven</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and among the inhabitants of the earth;</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and none can stay his hand</span><br /><span id=p27004035_16-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or say to him, &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p27004035_16-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v27004036-1>36&nbsp;</b>At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me. <b class=verse-num id=v27004037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble.</p></div>

The king answered and said to Daniel, &#8220;You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v27005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you. <b class=verse-num id=v27005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v27005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems.

And the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them.

And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v27006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. <b class=verse-num id=v27006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then these men said, &#8220;We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, &#8220;O King Darius, live forever! <b class=verse-num id=v27006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. <b class=verse-num id=v27006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.</p><p id=p27006009_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. <b class=verse-num id=v27006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God. <b class=verse-num id=v27006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, &#8220;O king! Did you not sign an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?&#8221; The king answered and said, &#8220;The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then they answered and said before the king, &#8220;Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006013_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him. <b class=verse-num id=v27006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, &#8220;Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.&#8221;</p><p id=p27006015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared to Daniel, &#8220;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. <b class=verse-num id=v27006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.</p><p id=p27006018_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v27006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. <b class=verse-num id=v27006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish.

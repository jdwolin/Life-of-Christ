<h3 id=p12001001_01-1>Elijah Denounces Ahaziah</h3><p id=p12001001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v12001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.</p><p id=p12001001_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, &#8220;Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, &#8220;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, &#8216;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? <b class=verse-num id=v12001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221; So Elijah went.</p><p id=p12001004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, &#8220;Why have you returned?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;There came a man to meet us, and said to us, &#8216;Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They answered him, &#8220;He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;It is Elijah the Tishbite.&#8221;</p><p id=p12001008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &#8220;O man of God, the king says, &#8216;Come down.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, &#8220;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&#8221; Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p id=p12001010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, &#8220;O man of God, this is the king&#8217;s order, &#8216;Come down quickly!&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Elijah answered them, &#8220;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&#8221; Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p id=p12001012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, &#8220;O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight. <b class=verse-num id=v12001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, &#8220;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&#8221; So he arose and went down with him to the king <b class=verse-num id=v12001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron&#8212;is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?&#8212;therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p12001016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v12001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son. <b class=verse-num id=v12001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p></div>

Will you go with me to battle against Moab?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;By which way shall we march?&#8221; Jehoram answered, &#8220;By the way of the wilderness of Edom.&#8221;</p><p id=p12003008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them. <b class=verse-num id=v12003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Israel said, &#8220;Alas! The LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?&#8221; Then one of the king of Israel&#8217;s servants answered, &#8220;Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;The word of the LORD is with him.&#8221; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</p><p id=p12003012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, &#8220;What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.&#8221; But the king of Israel said to him, &#8220;No; it is the LORD who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Elisha said, &#8220;As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I have regard for Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would neither look at you nor see you. <b class=verse-num id=v12003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But now bring me a musician.&#8221; And when the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon him. <b class=verse-num id=v12003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;I will make this dry streambed full of pools.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v12003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For thus says the LORD, &#8216;You shall not see wind or rain, but that streambed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your livestock, and your animals.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v12003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>This is a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also give the Moabites into your hand, <b class=verse-num id=v12003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree and stop up all springs of water and ruin every good piece of land with stones.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.</p><p id=p12003020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v12003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out and were drawn up at the border. <b class=verse-num id=v12003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And when they rose early in the morning and the sun shone on the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood. <b class=verse-num id=v12003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;This is blood; the kings have surely fought together and struck one another down. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v12003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and struck the Moabites, till they fled before them. And they went forward, striking the Moabites as they went. <b class=verse-num id=v12003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land every man threw a stone until it was covered. They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees, till only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded and attacked it. <b class=verse-num id=v12003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him 700 swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom, but they could not. <b class=verse-num id=v12003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel. And they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.</p></div>

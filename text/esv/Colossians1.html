Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel, <b class=verse-num id=v51001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing&#8212;as it also does among you, since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth, <b class=verse-num id=v51001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf <b class=verse-num id=v51001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and has made known to us your love in the Spirit.</p><p id=p51001008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v51001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, <b class=verse-num id=v51001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; <b class=verse-num id=v51001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy; <b class=verse-num id=v51001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. <b class=verse-num id=v51001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, <b class=verse-num id=v51001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p><h3 id=p51001014_05-1>The Preeminence of Christ</h3><p id=p51001014_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v51001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. <b class=verse-num id=v51001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&#8212;all things were created through him and for him. <b class=verse-num id=v51001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <b class=verse-num id=v51001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. <b class=verse-num id=v51001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, <b class=verse-num id=v51001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.</p><p id=p51001020_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v51001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, <b class=verse-num id=v51001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, <b class=verse-num id=v51001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.</p><h3 id=p51001023_09-1>Paul&#8217;s Ministry to the Church</h3><p id=p51001023_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v51001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ&#8217;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, <b class=verse-num id=v51001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, <b class=verse-num id=v51001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. <b class=verse-num id=v51001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <b class=verse-num id=v51001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v51001029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.</p></div>

<p id=p51002001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v51002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, <b class=verse-num id=v51002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God&#8217;s mystery, which is Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v51002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <b class=verse-num id=v51002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments. <b class=verse-num id=v51002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.</p><h3 id=p51002005_01-1>Alive in Christ</h3><p id=p51002005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v51002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, <b class=verse-num id=v51002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p><p id=p51002007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v51002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v51002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, <b class=verse-num id=v51002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. <b class=verse-num id=v51002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v51002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v51002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, <b class=verse-num id=v51002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. <b class=verse-num id=v51002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.</p><h3 id=p51002015_04-1>Let No One Disqualify You</h3><p id=p51002015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v51002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v51002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v51002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, <b class=verse-num id=v51002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.</p><p id=p51002019_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v51002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v51002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v51002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>(referring to things that all perish as they are used)&#8212;according to human precepts and teachings? <b class=verse-num id=v51002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.</p></div>

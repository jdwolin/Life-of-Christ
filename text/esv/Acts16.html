<h3 id=p44015001_01-1>The Jerusalem Council</h3><p id=p44015001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, &#8220;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. <b class=verse-num id=v44015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v44015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. <b class=verse-num id=v44015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, &#8220;It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.&#8221;</p><p id=p44015005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. <b class=verse-num id=v44015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, &#8220;Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. <b class=verse-num id=v44015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, <b class=verse-num id=v44015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. <b class=verse-num id=v44015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? <b class=verse-num id=v44015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.&#8221;</p><p id=p44015011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. <b class=verse-num id=v44015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>After they finished speaking, James replied, &#8220;Brothers, listen to me. <b class=verse-num id=v44015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. <b class=verse-num id=v44015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p44015016_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8216;After this I will return,</span><br /><span id=p44015016_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen;</span><br /><span id=p44015016_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will rebuild its ruins,</span><br /><span id=p44015016_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will restore it,</span><br /><span id=p44015017_04-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v44015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord,</span><br /><span id=p44015017_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the Gentiles who are called by my name,</span><br /><span id=p44015017_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the Lord, who makes these things <b class=verse-num inline id=v44015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>known from of old.&#8217;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p44015018_04-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v44015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, <b class=verse-num id=v44015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. <b class=verse-num id=v44015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44015021_04-1>The Council&#8217;s Letter to Gentile Believers</h3><p id=p44015021_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, <b class=verse-num id=v44015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>with the following letter: &#8220;The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. <b class=verse-num id=v44015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, <b class=verse-num id=v44015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, <b class=verse-num id=v44015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v44015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. <b class=verse-num id=v44015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: <b class=verse-num id=v44015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&#8221;</p><p id=p44015029_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. <b class=verse-num id=v44015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. <b class=verse-num id=v44015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. <b class=verse-num id=v44015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. <b class=verse-num id=v44015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p><h3 id=p44015035_10-1>Paul and Barnabas Separate</h3><p id=p44015035_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v44015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &#8220;Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. <b class=verse-num id=v44015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. <b class=verse-num id=v44015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, <b class=verse-num id=v44015040-1>40&nbsp;</b>but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v44015041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</p></div>

A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v44016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. <b class=verse-num id=v44016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v44016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.</p><h3 id=p44016005_06-1>The Macedonian Call</h3><p id=p44016005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. <b class=verse-num id=v44016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. <b class=verse-num id=v44016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. <b class=verse-num id=v44016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, &#8220;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p><h3 id=p44016010_09-1>The Conversion of Lydia</h3><p id=p44016010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, <b class=verse-num id=v44016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. <b class=verse-num id=v44016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. <b class=verse-num id=v44016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44016015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, &#8220;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&#8221; And she prevailed upon us.</p><h3 id=p44016015_13-1>Paul and Silas in Prison</h3><p id=p44016015_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. <b class=verse-num id=v44016017-1>17&nbsp;</b>She followed Paul and us, crying out, &#8220;These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And this she kept doing for many days.

And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&#8217;s bonds were unfastened. <b class=verse-num id=v44016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. <b class=verse-num id=v44016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But Paul cried with a loud voice, &#8220;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. <b class=verse-num id=v44016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he brought them out and said, &#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. <b class=verse-num id=v44016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. <b class=verse-num id=v44016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.</p><p id=p44016034_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v44016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, &#8220;Let those men go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &#8220;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But Paul said to them, &#8220;They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44016038-1>38&nbsp;</b>The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. <b class=verse-num id=v44016039-1>39&nbsp;</b>So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. <b class=verse-num id=v44016040-1>40&nbsp;</b>So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14030001_01-1>Passover Celebrated</h3><p id=p14030001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14030001-1>30:1&nbsp;</b>Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14030002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v14030003-1>3&nbsp;</b>for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v14030004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v14030005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it as often as prescribed. <b class=verse-num id=v14030006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, &#8220;O people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. <b class=verse-num id=v14030007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were faithless to the LORD God of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as you see. <b class=verse-num id=v14030008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD and come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you. <b class=verse-num id=v14030009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your children will find compassion with their captors and return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.&#8221;</p><p id=p14030009_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v14030010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them. <b class=verse-num id=v14030011-1>11&nbsp;</b>However, some men of Asher, of Manasseh, and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14030012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.</p><p id=p14030012_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v14030013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very great assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v14030014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the brook Kidron. <b class=verse-num id=v14030015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, so that they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14030016-1>16&nbsp;</b>They took their accustomed posts according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests threw the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites. <b class=verse-num id=v14030017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate it to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14030018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For a majority of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, &#8220;May the good LORD pardon everyone <b class=verse-num id=v14030019-1>19&nbsp;</b>who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary&#8217;s rules of cleanness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14030020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people. <b class=verse-num id=v14030021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with all their might to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14030022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the LORD. So they ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p><p id=p14030022_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v14030023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days. So they kept it for another seven days with gladness. <b class=verse-num id=v14030024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. And the priests consecrated themselves in great numbers. <b class=verse-num id=v14030025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who lived in Judah, rejoiced. <b class=verse-num id=v14030026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14030027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14031001_01-1>Hezekiah Organizes the Priests</h3><p id=p14031001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14031001-1>31:1&nbsp;</b>Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the Asherim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession.</p><p id=p14031001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14031002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of the LORD and to give thanks and praise. <b class=verse-num id=v14031003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, as it is written in the Law of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14031004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the Law of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14031005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. <b class=verse-num id=v14031006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things that had been dedicated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps. <b class=verse-num id=v14031007-1>7&nbsp;</b>In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. <b class=verse-num id=v14031008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14031009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps. <b class=verse-num id=v14031010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Azariah the chief priest, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, &#8220;Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed his people, so that we have this large amount left.&#8221;</p><p id=p14031010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14031011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them. <b class=verse-num id=v14031012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shimei his brother as second, <b class=verse-num id=v14031013-1>13&nbsp;</b>while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God. <b class=verse-num id=v14031014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the LORD and the most holy offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v14031015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their brothers, old and young alike, by divisions, <b class=verse-num id=v14031016-1>16&nbsp;</b>except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upward&#8212;all who entered the house of the LORD as the duty of each day required&#8212;for their service according to their offices, by their divisions. <b class=verse-num id=v14031017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers&#8217; houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices, by their divisions. <b class=verse-num id=v14031018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole assembly, for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy. <b class=verse-num id=v14031019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities, there were men in the several cities who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone among the Levites who was enrolled.</p><p id=p14031019_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14031020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14031021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered.</p></div>

He also made weapons and shields in abundance. <b class=verse-num id=v14032006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he set combat commanders over the people and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14032007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him, for there are more with us than with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14032008-1>8&nbsp;</b>With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles.&#8221; And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p><h3 id=p14032008_04-1>Sennacherib Blasphemes</h3><p id=p14032008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032009-1>9&nbsp;</b>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14032010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, &#8216;On what are you trusting, that you endure the siege in Jerusalem? <b class=verse-num id=v14032011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, &#8220;The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v14032012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, &#8220;Before one altar you shall worship, and on it you shall burn your sacrifices&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v14032013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v14032014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers devoted to destruction was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v14032015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p14032015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And his servants said still more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah. <b class=verse-num id=v14032017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, &#8220;Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city. <b class=verse-num id=v14032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men&#8217;s hands.</p><h3 id=p14032019_06-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Delivers Jerusalem</h3><p id=p14032019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v14032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria.

Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p><p id=p14032026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels; <b class=verse-num id=v14032028-1>28&nbsp;</b>storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds. <b class=verse-num id=v14032029-1>29&nbsp;</b>He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions. <b class=verse-num id=v14032030-1>30&nbsp;</b>This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. <b class=verse-num id=v14032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart.</p><p id=p14032031_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14032033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death.

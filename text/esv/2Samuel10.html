<h3 id=p10009001_01-1>David&#8217;s Kindness to Mephibosheth</h3><p id=p10009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan&#8217;s sake?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, &#8220;Are you Ziba?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I am your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?&#8221; Ziba said to the king, &#8220;There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The king said to him, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; And Ziba said to the king, &#8220;He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar. <b class=verse-num id=v10009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, &#8220;Mephibosheth!&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Behold, I am your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And David said to him, &#8220;Do not fear, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he paid homage and said, &#8220;What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I?&#8221;</p><p id=p10009008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the king called Ziba, Saul&#8217;s servant, and said to him, &#8220;All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master&#8217;s grandson. <b class=verse-num id=v10009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce, that your master&#8217;s grandson may have bread to eat. But Mephibosheth your master&#8217;s grandson shall always eat at my table.&#8221; Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. <b class=verse-num id=v10009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Ziba said to the king, &#8220;According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do.&#8221; So Mephibosheth ate at David&#8217;s table, like one of the king&#8217;s sons. <b class=verse-num id=v10009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba&#8217;s house became Mephibosheth&#8217;s servants. <b class=verse-num id=v10009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate always at the king&#8217;s table. Now he was lame in both his feet.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10010001_01-1>David Defeats Ammon and Syria</h3><p id=p10010001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v10010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;I will deal loyally with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.&#8221; So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David&#8217;s servants came into the land of the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v10010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, &#8220;Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Hanun took David&#8217;s servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away. <b class=verse-num id=v10010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, &#8220;Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.&#8221;</p><p id=p10010005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob, 12,000 men. <b class=verse-num id=v10010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men. <b class=verse-num id=v10010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.</p><p id=p10010008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians. <b class=verse-num id=v10010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v10010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. <b class=verse-num id=v10010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him. <b class=verse-num id=v10010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p10010014_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. <b class=verse-num id=v10010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates. They came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. <b class=verse-num id=v10010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 700 chariots, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there. <b class=verse-num id=v10010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore.</p></div>

And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</p><p id=p10011001_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king&#8217;s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. <b class=verse-num id=v10011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, &#8220;Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. <b class=verse-num id=v10011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, &#8220;I am pregnant.&#8221;</p><p id=p10011005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So David sent word to Joab, &#8220;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&#8221; And Joab sent Uriah to David. <b class=verse-num id=v10011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going. <b class=verse-num id=v10011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Uriah, &#8220;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&#8221; And Uriah went out of the king&#8217;s house, and there followed him a present from the king. <b class=verse-num id=v10011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&#8217;s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. <b class=verse-num id=v10011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When they told David, &#8220;Uriah did not go down to his house,&#8221; David said to Uriah, &#8220;Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Uriah said to David, &#8220;The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Uriah, &#8220;Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back.&#8221; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. <b class=verse-num id=v10011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</p><p id=p10011013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. <b class=verse-num id=v10011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In the letter he wrote, &#8220;Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men. <b class=verse-num id=v10011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died. <b class=verse-num id=v10011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting. <b class=verse-num id=v10011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he instructed the messenger, &#8220;When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king, <b class=verse-num id=v10011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>then, if the king&#8217;s anger rises, and if he says to you, &#8216;Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? <b class=verse-num id=v10011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?&#8217; then you shall say, &#8216;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p10011021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell. <b class=verse-num id=v10011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The messenger said to David, &#8220;The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v10011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king&#8217;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>David said to the messenger, &#8220;Thus shall you say to Joab, &#8216;Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.&#8217; And encourage him.&#8221;</p><p id=p10011025_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband. <b class=verse-num id=v10011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p></div>

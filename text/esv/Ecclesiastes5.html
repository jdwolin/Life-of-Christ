<h3 id=p21004001_01-1>Evil Under the Sun</h3><p id=p21004001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v21004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>Again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them. <b class=verse-num id=v21004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive. <b class=verse-num id=v21004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.</p><p id=p21004003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man&#8217;s envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p><p id=p21004004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.</p><p id=p21004005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.</p><p id=p21004006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Again, I saw vanity under the sun: <b class=verse-num id=v21004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, &#8220;For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?&#8221; This also is vanity and an unhappy business.</p><p id=p21004008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. <b class=verse-num id=v21004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! <b class=verse-num id=v21004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? <b class=verse-num id=v21004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him&#8212;a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p><p id=p21004012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v21004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice. <b class=verse-num id=v21004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For he went from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor. <b class=verse-num id=v21004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that youth who was to stand in the king&#8217;s place. <b class=verse-num id=v21004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p></div>

<h3 id=p21005001_01-1>Fear God</h3><p id=p21005001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v21005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil. <b class=verse-num id=v21005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few. <b class=verse-num id=v21005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For a dream comes with much business, and a fool&#8217;s voice with many words.</p><p id=p21005003_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v21005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow. <b class=verse-num id=v21005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. <b class=verse-num id=v21005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands? <b class=verse-num id=v21005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear.</p><h3 id=p21005007_03-1>The Vanity of Wealth and Honor</h3><p id=p21005007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v21005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them. <b class=verse-num id=v21005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p><p id=p21005009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v21005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity. <b class=verse-num id=v21005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? <b class=verse-num id=v21005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p><p id=p21005012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v21005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, <b class=verse-num id=v21005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v21005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As he came from his mother&#8217;s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v21005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? <b class=verse-num id=v21005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p><p id=p21005017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v21005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. <b class=verse-num id=v21005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil&#8212;this is the gift of God. <b class=verse-num id=v21005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.</p></div>

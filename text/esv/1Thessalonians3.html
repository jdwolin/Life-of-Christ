<h3 id=p52002001_01-1>Paul&#8217;s Ministry to the Thessalonians</h3><p id=p52002001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v52002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain. <b class=verse-num id=v52002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict. <b class=verse-num id=v52002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive, <b class=verse-num id=v52002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts. <b class=verse-num id=v52002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed&#8212;God is witness. <b class=verse-num id=v52002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v52002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children. <b class=verse-num id=v52002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.</p><p id=p52002008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v52002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. <b class=verse-num id=v52002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers. <b class=verse-num id=v52002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For you know how, like a father with his children, <b class=verse-num id=v52002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</p><p id=p52002012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v52002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers. <b class=verse-num id=v52002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, <b class=verse-num id=v52002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind <b class=verse-num id=v52002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved&#8212;so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last!</p><h3 id=p52002016_06-1>Paul&#8217;s Longing to See Them Again</h3><p id=p52002016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v52002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face, <b class=verse-num id=v52002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>because we wanted to come to you&#8212;I, Paul, again and again&#8212;but Satan hindered us. <b class=verse-num id=v52002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? <b class=verse-num id=v52002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For you are our glory and joy.</p></div>

<p id=p52003001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v52003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone, <b class=verse-num id=v52003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and we sent Timothy, our brother and God&#8217;s coworker in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith, <b class=verse-num id=v52003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this. <b class=verse-num id=v52003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it has come to pass, and just as you know. <b class=verse-num id=v52003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to learn about your faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain.</p><h3 id=p52003005_01-1>Timothy&#8217;s Encouraging Report</h3><p id=p52003005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v52003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us, as we long to see you&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v52003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>for this reason, brothers, in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith. <b class=verse-num id=v52003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For now we live, if you are standing fast in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v52003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God, <b class=verse-num id=v52003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>as we pray most earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?</p><p id=p52003010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v52003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, <b class=verse-num id=v52003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, <b class=verse-num id=v52003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</p></div>

But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more, <b class=verse-num id=v52004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, <b class=verse-num id=v52004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.</p><h3 id=p52004012_06-1>The Coming of the Lord</h3><p id=p52004012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v52004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. <b class=verse-num id=v52004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. <b class=verse-num id=v52004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. <b class=verse-num id=v52004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. <b class=verse-num id=v52004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v52004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore encourage one another with these words.</p></div>

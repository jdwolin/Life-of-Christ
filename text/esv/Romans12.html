<h3 id=p45011001_01-1>The Remnant of Israel</h3><p id=p45011001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. <b class=verse-num id=v45011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v45011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But what is God&#8217;s reply to him? &#8220;I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. <b class=verse-num id=v45011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</p><p id=p45011006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, <b class=verse-num id=v45011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>as it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45011008_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;God gave them a spirit of stupor,</span><br /><span id=p45011008_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes that would not see</span><br /><span id=p45011008_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ears that would not hear,</span><br /><span id=p45011008_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;down to this very day.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45011008_05-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v45011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David says,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45011009_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Let their table become a snare and a trap,</span><br /><span id=p45011009_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</span><br /><span id=p45011010_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,</span><br /><span id=p45011010_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bend their backs forever.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p45011010_05-1>Gentiles Grafted In</h3><p id=p45011010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. <b class=verse-num id=v45011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</p><p id=p45011012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry <b class=verse-num id=v45011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. <b class=verse-num id=v45011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? <b class=verse-num id=v45011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</p><p id=p45011016_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, <b class=verse-num id=v45011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. <b class=verse-num id=v45011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then you will say, &#8220;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear. <b class=verse-num id=v45011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. <b class=verse-num id=v45011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God&#8217;s kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. <b class=verse-num id=v45011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. <b class=verse-num id=v45011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</p><h3 id=p45011024_08-1>The Mystery of Israel&#8217;s Salvation</h3><p id=p45011024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. <b class=verse-num id=v45011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45011026_13-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The Deliverer will come from Zion,</span><br /><span id=p45011026_13-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will banish ungodliness from Jacob&#8221;;</span><br /><span id=p45011027_13-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;and this will be my covenant with them</span><br /><span id=p45011027_13-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I take away their sins.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45011027_13-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v45011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. <b class=verse-num id=v45011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. <b class=verse-num id=v45011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, <b class=verse-num id=v45011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. <b class=verse-num id=v45011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.</p><p id=p45011032_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v45011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!

For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. <b class=verse-num id=v45013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. <b class=verse-num id=v45013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, <b class=verse-num id=v45013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for he is God&#8217;s servant for your good.

For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. <b class=verse-num id=v45013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. <b class=verse-num id=v45013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. <b class=verse-num id=v45013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p></div>

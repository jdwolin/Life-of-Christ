<h3 id=p47009001_01-1>The Collection for Christians in Jerusalem</h3><p id=p47009001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints, <b class=verse-num id=v47009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them. <b class=verse-num id=v47009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be. <b class=verse-num id=v47009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated&#8212;to say nothing of you&#8212;for being so confident. <b class=verse-num id=v47009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.</p><h3 id=p47009005_07-1>The Cheerful Giver</h3><p id=p47009005_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v47009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. <b class=verse-num id=v47009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. <b class=verse-num id=v47009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. <b class=verse-num id=v47009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>As it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p47009009_10-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;</span><br /><span id=p47009009_10-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his righteousness endures forever.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p47009009_10-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v47009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v47009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. <b class=verse-num id=v47009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. <b class=verse-num id=v47009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others, <b class=verse-num id=v47009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. <b class=verse-num id=v47009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!</p></div>

If anyone is confident that he is Christ&#8217;s, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ&#8217;s, so also are we. <b class=verse-num id=v47010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed. <b class=verse-num id=v47010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters. <b class=verse-num id=v47010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For they say, &#8220;His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v47010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. <b class=verse-num id=v47010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Not that we dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.</p><p id=p47010012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v47010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even to you. <b class=verse-num id=v47010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others. But our hope is that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged, <b class=verse-num id=v47010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another&#8217;s area of influence. <b class=verse-num id=v47010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v47010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</p></div>

<h3 id=p47011001_01-1>Paul and the False Apostles</h3><p id=p47011001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v47011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me! <b class=verse-num id=v47011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. <b class=verse-num id=v47011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. <b class=verse-num id=v47011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</p><p id=p47011006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God&#8217;s gospel to you free of charge? <b class=verse-num id=v47011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. <b class=verse-num id=v47011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. <b class=verse-num id=v47011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. <b class=verse-num id=v47011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p><p id=p47011011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. <b class=verse-num id=v47011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v47011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. <b class=verse-num id=v47011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.</p><h3 id=p47011015_06-1>Paul&#8217;s Sufferings as an Apostle</h3><p id=p47011015_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. <b class=verse-num id=v47011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not as the Lord would but as a fool. <b class=verse-num id=v47011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. <b class=verse-num id=v47011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves! <b class=verse-num id=v47011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. <b class=verse-num id=v47011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!</p><p id=p47011021_11-1>But whatever anyone else dares to boast of&#8212;I am speaking as a fool&#8212;I also dare to boast of that. <b class=verse-num id=v47011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. <b class=verse-num id=v47011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one&#8212;I am talking like a madman&#8212;with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. <b class=verse-num id=v47011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. <b class=verse-num id=v47011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; <b class=verse-num id=v47011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v47011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. <b class=verse-num id=v47011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. <b class=verse-num id=v47011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?</p><p id=p47011029_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v47011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. <b class=verse-num id=v47011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. <b class=verse-num id=v47011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, <b class=verse-num id=v47011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.</p></div>

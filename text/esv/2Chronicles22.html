And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.</p><p id=p14021007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king of their own. <b class=verse-num id=v14021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all his chariots, and he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders. <b class=verse-num id=v14021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.</p><p id=p14021010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Moreover, he made high places in the hill country of Judah and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into whoredom and made Judah go astray. <b class=verse-num id=v14021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, &#8216;Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah, <b class=verse-num id=v14021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have enticed Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into whoredom, as the house of Ahab led Israel into whoredom, and also you have killed your brothers, of your father&#8217;s house, who were better than you, <b class=verse-num id=v14021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>behold, the LORD will bring a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions, <b class=verse-num id=v14021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and you yourself will have a severe sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p14021015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the anger of the Philistines and of the Arabians who are near the Ethiopians. <b class=verse-num id=v14021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they came up against Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king&#8217;s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son.</p><p id=p14021017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And after all this the LORD struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease. <b class=verse-num id=v14021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>In the course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed with no one&#8217;s regret. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14022001_01-1>Ahaziah Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14022001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. <b class=verse-num id=v14022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri. <b class=verse-num id=v14022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly. <b class=verse-num id=v14022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done. For after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing. <b class=verse-num id=v14022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He even followed their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram, <b class=verse-num id=v14022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was wounded.</p><p id=p14022006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there, he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. <b class=verse-num id=v14022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah&#8217;s brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them. <b class=verse-num id=v14022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He searched for Ahaziah, and he was captured while hiding in Samaria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, &#8220;He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.&#8221; And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom.</p><h3 id=p14022009_05-1>Athaliah Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14022009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king&#8217;s sons who were about to be put to death, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not put him to death. <b class=verse-num id=v14022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he remained with them six years, hidden in the house of God, while Athaliah reigned over the land.</p></div>

And Jehoiada said to them, &#8220;Behold, the king&#8217;s son! Let him reign, as the LORD spoke concerning the sons of David. <b class=verse-num id=v14023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>This is the thing that you shall do: of you priests and Levites who come off duty on the Sabbath, one third shall be gatekeepers, <b class=verse-num id=v14023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and one third shall be at the king&#8217;s house and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and ministering Levites. They may enter, for they are holy, but all the people shall keep the charge of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever enters the house shall be put to death.

And they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, &#8220;Long live the king.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14023011_04-1>Athaliah Executed</h3><p id=p14023011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went into the house of the LORD to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v14023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments leading in the celebration. And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, &#8220;Treason! Treason!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, &#8220;Bring her out between the ranks, and anyone who follows her is to be put to death with the sword.&#8221; For the priest said, &#8220;Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So they laid hands on her, and she went into the entrance of the horse gate of the king&#8217;s house, and they put her to death there.</p><h3 id=p14023015_06-1>Jehoiada&#8217;s Reforms</h3><p id=p14023015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v14023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the LORD&#8217;s people. <b class=verse-num id=v14023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. <b class=verse-num id=v14023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Jehoiada posted watchmen for the house of the LORD under the direction of the Levitical priests and the Levites whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David. <b class=verse-num id=v14023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v14023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the upper gate to the king&#8217;s house. And they set the king on the royal throne. <b class=verse-num id=v14023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.</p></div>

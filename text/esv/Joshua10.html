<h3 id=p06009001_01-1>The Gibeonite Deception</h3><p id=p06009001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this, <b class=verse-num id=v06009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel.</p><p id=p06009002_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v06009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, <b class=verse-num id=v06009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended, <b class=verse-num id=v06009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes. And all their provisions were dry and crumbly. <b class=verse-num id=v06009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, &#8220;We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, &#8220;Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They said to Joshua, &#8220;We are your servants.&#8221; And Joshua said to them, &#8220;Who are you? And where do you come from?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v06009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. <b class=verse-num id=v06009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, &#8216;Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, &#8220;We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly. <b class=verse-num id=v06009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the men took some of their provisions, but did not ask counsel from the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.</p><p id=p06009015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v06009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them. <b class=verse-num id=v06009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. <b class=verse-num id=v06009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders. <b class=verse-num id=v06009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But all the leaders said to all the congregation, &#8220;We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them. <b class=verse-num id=v06009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the leaders said to them, &#8220;Let them live.&#8221; So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.</p><p id=p06009021_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v06009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, &#8220;Why did you deceive us, saying, &#8216;We are very far from you,&#8217; when you dwell among us? <b class=verse-num id=v06009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall never be anything but servants, cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>They answered Joshua, &#8220;Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you&#8212;so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing. <b class=verse-num id=v06009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us, do it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel, and they did not kill them. <b class=verse-num id=v06009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place that he should choose.</p></div>

<h3 id=p06010001_01-1>The Sun Stands Still</h3><p id=p06010001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, <b class=verse-num id=v06010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors. <b class=verse-num id=v06010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v06010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.</p><p id=p06010005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, &#8220;Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. <b class=verse-num id=v06010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal. <b class=verse-num id=v06010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.</p><p id=p06010011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>At that time Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p06010012_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sun, stand still at Gibeon,</span><br /><span id=p06010012_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p06010013_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v06010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,</span><br /><span id=p06010013_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p06010013_05-1 class=same-paragraph>Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day. <b class=verse-num id=v06010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for the LORD fought for Israel.</p><p id=p06010014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</p><h3 id=p06010015_05-1>Five Amorite Kings Executed</h3><p id=p06010015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And it was told to Joshua, &#8220;The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, &#8220;Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them, <b class=verse-num id=v06010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, <b class=verse-num id=v06010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.</p><p id=p06010021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said, &#8220;Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. <b class=verse-num id=v06010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, &#8220;Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings.&#8221; Then they came near and put their feet on their necks. <b class=verse-num id=v06010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening. <b class=verse-num id=v06010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</p><p id=p06010027_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>As for Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p><h3 id=p06010028_09-1>Conquest of Southern Canaan</h3><p id=p06010028_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. <b class=verse-num id=v06010030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p><p id=p06010030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it. <b class=verse-num id=v06010032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.</p><p id=p06010032_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.</p><p id=p06010033_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it. <b class=verse-num id=v06010035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.</p><p id=p06010035_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it <b class=verse-num id=v06010037-1>37&nbsp;</b>and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.</p><p id=p06010037_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v06010038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it <b class=verse-num id=v06010039-1>39&nbsp;</b>and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining.

You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Joshua and all his warriors came suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v06011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining. <b class=verse-num id=v06011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joshua did to them just as the LORD said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.</p><p id=p06011009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms. <b class=verse-num id=v06011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction; there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v06011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v06011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; that Joshua burned. <b class=verse-num id=v06011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder.

He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.</p><p id=p06011015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negeb and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland <b class=verse-num id=v06011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death. <b class=verse-num id=v06011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. <b class=verse-num id=v06011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon.

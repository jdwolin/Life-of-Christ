<h3 id=p01032001_01-1>Jacob Fears Esau</h3><p id=p01032001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01032001-1>32:1&nbsp;</b>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when Jacob saw them he said, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s camp!&#8221; So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p><p id=p01032002_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, <b class=verse-num id=v01032004-1>4&nbsp;</b>instructing them, &#8220;Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, &#8216;I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now. <b class=verse-num id=v01032005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01032005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &#8220;We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, <b class=verse-num id=v01032008-1>8&nbsp;</b>thinking, &#8220;If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.&#8221;</p><p id=p01032008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said, &#8220;O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, &#8216;Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01032010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps. <b class=verse-num id=v01032011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children. <b class=verse-num id=v01032012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But you said, &#8216;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01032012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau, <b class=verse-num id=v01032014-1>14&nbsp;</b>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <b class=verse-num id=v01032015-1>15&nbsp;</b>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v01032016-1>16&nbsp;</b>These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, &#8220;Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He instructed the first, &#8220;When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, &#8216;To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>then you shall say, &#8216;They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, &#8220;You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him, <b class=verse-num id=v01032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and you shall say, &#8216;Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; For he thought, &#8220;I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p><h3 id=p01032021_04-1>Jacob Wrestles with God</h3><p id=p01032021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v01032022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. <b class=verse-num id=v01032023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had. <b class=verse-num id=v01032024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. <b class=verse-num id=v01032025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob&#8217;s hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Let me go, for the day has broken.&#8221; But Jacob said, &#8220;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Jacob.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then he said, &#8220;Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob asked him, &#8220;Please tell me your name.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;Why is it that you ask my name?&#8221; And there he blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01032030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip. <b class=verse-num id=v01032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip on the sinew of the thigh.</p></div>

So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants. <b class=verse-num id=v01033002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. <b class=verse-num id=v01033003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p><p id=p01033003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. <b class=verse-num id=v01033005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, &#8220;Who are these with you?&#8221; Jacob said, &#8220;The children whom God has graciously given your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down. <b class=verse-num id=v01033007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down. <b class=verse-num id=v01033008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Esau said, &#8220;What do you mean by all this company that I met?&#8221; Jacob answered, &#8220;To find favor in the sight of my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Esau said, &#8220;I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, &#8220;No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me. <b class=verse-num id=v01033011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.&#8221; Thus he urged him, and he took it.</p><p id=p01033011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Esau said, &#8220;Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to him, &#8220;My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die. <b class=verse-num id=v01033014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.&#8221;</p><p id=p01033014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Esau said, &#8220;Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. <b class=verse-num id=v01033017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock.

He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. <b class=verse-num id=v01034004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, &#8220;Get me this girl for my wife.&#8221;</p><p id=p01034004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came. <b class=verse-num id=v01034006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01034007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob&#8217;s daughter, for such a thing must not be done.</p><p id=p01034007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, &#8220;The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter.

Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. <b class=verse-num id=v01034010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01034011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, &#8220;Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. <b class=verse-num id=v01034012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Ask me for as great a bride-price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.&#8221;</p><p id=p01034012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah. <b class=verse-num id=v01034014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They said to them, &#8220;We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. <b class=verse-num id=v01034015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Only on this condition will we agree with you&#8212;that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v01034016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people. <b class=verse-num id=v01034017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.&#8221;</p><p id=p01034017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor&#8217;s son Shechem. <b class=verse-num id=v01034019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob&#8217;s daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01034020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v01034021-1>21&nbsp;</b>&#8220;These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them.

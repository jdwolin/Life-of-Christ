<h3 id=p14013001_01-1>Abijah Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14013001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.</p><p id=p14013002_05-1>Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <b class=verse-num id=v14013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Abijah went out to battle, having an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. And Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with 800,000 chosen mighty warriors. <b class=verse-num id=v14013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, &#8220;Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel! <b class=verse-num id=v14013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt? <b class=verse-num id=v14013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord, <b class=verse-num id=v14013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and certain worthless scoundrels gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute and could not withstand them.</p><p id=p14013007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods. <b class=verse-num id=v14013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes for ordination with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v14013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service. <b class=verse-num id=v14013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out the showbread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken him. <b class=verse-num id=v14013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed.&#8221;</p><p id=p14013012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come upon them from behind. Thus his troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them. <b class=verse-num id=v14013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was in front of and behind them. And they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets. <b class=verse-num id=v14013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The men of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand. <b class=verse-num id=v14013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men. <b class=verse-num id=v14013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages. <b class=verse-num id=v14013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down, and he died. <b class=verse-num id=v14013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. <b class=verse-num id=v14013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14014001_01-1>Asa Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14014001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years. <b class=verse-num id=v14014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He took away the foreign altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and cut down the Asherim <b class=verse-num id=v14014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to keep the law and the commandment. <b class=verse-num id=v14014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He also took out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him. <b class=verse-num id=v14014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, for the LORD gave him peace. <b class=verse-num id=v14014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he said to Judah, &#8220;Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought him, and he has given us peace on every side.&#8221; So they built and prospered. <b class=verse-num id=v14014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, armed with large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin that carried shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.</p><p id=p14014008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. <b class=verse-num id=v14014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <b class=verse-num id=v14014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Asa cried to the LORD his God, &#8220;O LORD, there is none like you to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. <b class=verse-num id=v14014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive, for they were broken before the LORD and his army. The men of Judah carried away very much spoil. <b class=verse-num id=v14014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they attacked all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD was upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. <b class=verse-num id=v14014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they struck down the tents of those who had livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14015001_01-1>Asa&#8217;s Religious Reforms</h3><p id=p14015001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>The Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded, <b class=verse-num id=v14015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, &#8220;Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. <b class=verse-num id=v14015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law, <b class=verse-num id=v14015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them. <b class=verse-num id=v14015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. <b class=verse-num id=v14015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>They were broken in pieces. Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress. <b class=verse-num id=v14015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.&#8221;</p><p id=p14015007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>As soon as Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded, he took courage and put away the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. <b class=verse-num id=v14015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They sacrificed to the LORD on that day from the spoil that they had brought 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v14015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul, <b class=verse-num id=v14015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>but that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman. <b class=verse-num id=v14015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They swore an oath to the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns. <b class=verse-num id=v14015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.</p><p id=p14015015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Even Maacah, his mother, King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made a detestable image for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron. <b class=verse-num id=v14015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true all his days. <b class=verse-num id=v14015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he brought into the house of God the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels. <b class=verse-num id=v14015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.</p></div>

But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v62002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. <b class=verse-num id=v62002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. <b class=verse-num id=v62002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Whoever says &#8220;I know him&#8221; but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, <b class=verse-num id=v62002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: <b class=verse-num id=v62002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.</p><h3 id=p62002006_04-1>The New Commandment</h3><p id=p62002006_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. <b class=verse-num id=v62002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. <b class=verse-num id=v62002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. <b class=verse-num id=v62002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. <b class=verse-num id=v62002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p62002012_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v62002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you, little children,</span><br /><span id=p62002012_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because your sins are forgiven for his name&#8217;s sake.</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v62002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you, fathers,</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you know him who is from the beginning.</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to you, young men,</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you have overcome the evil one.</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you, children,</span><br /><span id=p62002013_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you know the Father.</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v62002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you, fathers,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you know him who is from the beginning.</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you, young men,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you are strong,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the word of God abides in you,</span><br /><span id=p62002014_07-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have overcome the evil one.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><h3 id=p62002014_07-1>Do Not Love the World</h3><p id=p62002014_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <b class=verse-num id=v62002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For all that is in the world&#8212;the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life&#8212;is not from the Father but is from the world. <b class=verse-num id=v62002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.</p><h3 id=p62002017_12-1>Warning Concerning Antichrists</h3><p id=p62002017_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. <b class=verse-num id=v62002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. <b class=verse-num id=v62002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. <b class=verse-num id=v62002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. <b class=verse-num id=v62002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. <b class=verse-num id=v62002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. <b class=verse-num id=v62002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. <b class=verse-num id=v62002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And this is the promise that he made to us&#8212;eternal life.</p><p id=p62002025_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. <b class=verse-num id=v62002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie&#8212;just as it has taught you, abide in him.</p><h3 id=p62002027_15-1>Children of God</h3><p id=p62002027_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v62002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. <b class=verse-num id=v62002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.</p></div>

<p id=p62003001_01-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v62003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. <b class=verse-num id=v62003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Beloved, we are God&#8217;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. <b class=verse-num id=v62003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.</p><p id=p62003003_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. <b class=verse-num id=v62003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. <b class=verse-num id=v62003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. <b class=verse-num id=v62003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v62003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. <b class=verse-num id=v62003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God&#8217;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. <b class=verse-num id=v62003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.</p><h3 id=p62003010_01-1>Love One Another</h3><p id=p62003010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. <b class=verse-num id=v62003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&#8217;s righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v62003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you. <b class=verse-num id=v62003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. <b class=verse-num id=v62003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</p><p id=p62003015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v62003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if anyone has the world&#8217;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&#8217;s love abide in him? <b class=verse-num id=v62003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</p><p id=p62003018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v62003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; <b class=verse-num id=v62003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. <b class=verse-num id=v62003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; <b class=verse-num id=v62003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. <b class=verse-num id=v62003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. <b class=verse-num id=v62003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.</p></div>

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. <b class=verse-num id=v62004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. <b class=verse-num id=v62004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. <b class=verse-num id=v62004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>We are from God.

God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. <b class=verse-num id=v62004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. <b class=verse-num id=v62004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. <b class=verse-num id=v62004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>We love because he first loved us. <b class=verse-num id=v62004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>If anyone says, &#8220;I love God,&#8221; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. <b class=verse-num id=v62004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01041001_01-1>Joseph Interprets Pharaoh&#8217;s Dreams</h3><p id=p01041001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01041001-1>41:1&nbsp;</b>After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile, <b class=verse-num id=v01041002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows, attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass. <b class=verse-num id=v01041003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. <b class=verse-num id=v01041004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke. <b class=verse-num id=v01041005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. <b class=verse-num id=v01041006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. <b class=verse-num id=v01041007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. <b class=verse-num id=v01041008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</p><p id=p01041008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, &#8220;I remember my offenses today. <b class=verse-num id=v01041010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, <b class=verse-num id=v01041011-1>11&nbsp;</b>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation. <b class=verse-num id=v01041012-1>12&nbsp;</b>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. <b class=verse-num id=v01041013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v01041015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Joseph answered Pharaoh, &#8220;It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile. <b class=verse-num id=v01041018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. <b class=verse-num id=v01041019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows, <b class=verse-num id=v01041021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke. <b class=verse-num id=v01041022-1>22&nbsp;</b>I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good. <b class=verse-num id=v01041023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, <b class=verse-num id=v01041024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &#8220;The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <b class=verse-num id=v01041026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. <b class=verse-num id=v01041027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. <b class=verse-num id=v01041028-1>28&nbsp;</b>It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <b class=verse-num id=v01041029-1>29&nbsp;</b>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v01041030-1>30&nbsp;</b>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, <b class=verse-num id=v01041031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. <b class=verse-num id=v01041032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And the doubling of Pharaoh&#8217;s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about. <b class=verse-num id=v01041033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. <b class=verse-num id=v01041035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. <b class=verse-num id=v01041036-1>36&nbsp;</b>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p01041036_05-1>Joseph Rises to Power</h3><p id=p01041036_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041037-1>37&nbsp;</b>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v01041038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to his servants, &#8220;Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. <b class=verse-num id=v01041040-1>40&nbsp;</b>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041042-1>42&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph&#8217;s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. <b class=verse-num id=v01041043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, &#8220;Bow the knee!&#8221; Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh called Joseph&#8217;s name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p><p id=p01041045_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041047-1>47&nbsp;</b>During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly, <b class=verse-num id=v01041048-1>48&nbsp;</b>and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it. <b class=verse-num id=v01041049-1>49&nbsp;</b>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</p><p id=p01041049_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01041051-1>51&nbsp;</b>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. &#8220;For,&#8221; he said, &#8220;God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01041052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The name of the second he called Ephraim, &#8220;For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041052_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041053-1>53&nbsp;</b>The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end, <b class=verse-num id=v01041054-1>54&nbsp;</b>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <b class=verse-num id=v01041055-1>55&nbsp;</b>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &#8220;Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.&#8221;</p><p id=p01041055_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v01041056-1>56&nbsp;</b>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01041057-1>57&nbsp;</b>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01042001_01-1>Joseph&#8217;s Brothers Go to Egypt</h3><p id=p01042001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01042001-1>42:1&nbsp;</b>When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, &#8220;Why do you look at one another?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So ten of Joseph&#8217;s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v01042004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph&#8217;s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him. <b class=verse-num id=v01042005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p><p id=p01042005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph&#8217;s brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01042007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; he said. They said, &#8220;From the land of Canaan, to buy food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. <b class=verse-num id=v01042009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, &#8220;You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. <b class=verse-num id=v01042011-1>11&nbsp;</b>We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.&#8221;</p><p id=p01042011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But Joseph said to them, &#8220;It is as I said to you. You are spies. <b class=verse-num id=v01042015-1>15&nbsp;</b>By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. <b class=verse-num id=v01042016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he put them all together in custody for three days.</p><p id=p01042017_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042018-1>18&nbsp;</b>On the third day Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do this and you will live, for I fear God: <b class=verse-num id=v01042019-1>19&nbsp;</b>if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, <b class=verse-num id=v01042020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.&#8221; And they did so. <b class=verse-num id=v01042021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they said to one another, &#8220;In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Reuben answered them, &#8220;Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042023-1>23&nbsp;</b>They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. <b class=verse-num id=v01042024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v01042025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man&#8217;s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.</p><p id=p01042025_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed. <b class=verse-num id=v01042027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack. <b class=verse-num id=v01042028-1>28&nbsp;</b>He said to his brothers, &#8220;My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!&#8221; At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, &#8220;What is this that God has done to us?&#8221;</p><p id=p01042028_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v01042030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01042031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But we said to him, &#8216;We are honest men; we have never been spies. <b class=verse-num id=v01042032-1>32&nbsp;</b>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01042033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, &#8216;By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. <b class=verse-num id=v01042034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p01042034_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01042035-1>35&nbsp;</b>As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man&#8217;s bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v01042036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And Jacob their father said to them, &#8220;You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then Reuben said to his father, &#8220;Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01042038-1>38&nbsp;</b>But he said, &#8220;My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.&#8221;</p></div>

Do you have another brother?&#8217; What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, &#8216;Bring your brother down&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Judah said to Israel his father, &#8220;Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones. <b class=verse-num id=v01043009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I will be a pledge of his safety.

They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.</p><p id=p01043015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01043016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, &#8220;Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01043018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph&#8217;s house, and they said, &#8220;It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So they went up to the steward of Joseph&#8217;s house and spoke with him at the door of the house, <b class=verse-num id=v01043020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food. <b class=verse-num id=v01043021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man&#8217;s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us, <b class=verse-num id=v01043022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He replied, &#8220;Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money.&#8221; Then he brought Simeon out to them. <b class=verse-num id=v01043024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And when the man had brought the men into Joseph&#8217;s house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder, <b class=verse-num id=v01043025-1>25&nbsp;</b>they prepared the present for Joseph&#8217;s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p><p id=p01043025_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01043026-1>26&nbsp;</b>When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v01043027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he inquired about their welfare and said, &#8220;Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043028-1>28&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.&#8221; And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v01043029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&#8217;s son, and said, &#8220;Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. <b class=verse-num id=v01043031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, &#8220;Serve the food.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01043032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v01043033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement. <b class=verse-num id=v01043034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Portions were taken to them from Joseph&#8217;s table, but Benjamin&#8217;s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.</p></div>

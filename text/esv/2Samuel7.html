<h3 id=p10006001_01-1>The Ark Brought to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10006001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. <b class=verse-num id=v10006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who sits enthroned on the cherubim. <b class=verse-num id=v10006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart, <b class=verse-num id=v10006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark.</p><h3 id=p10006004_06-1>Uzzah and the Ark</h3><p id=p10006004_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals. <b class=verse-num id=v10006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. <b class=verse-num id=v10006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God. <b class=verse-num id=v10006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v10006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and he said, &#8220;How can the ark of the LORD come to me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So David was not willing to take the ark of the LORD into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. <b class=verse-num id=v10006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.</p><p id=p10006011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And it was told King David, &#8220;The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.&#8221; So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing. <b class=verse-num id=v10006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal. <b class=verse-num id=v10006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David danced before the LORD with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v10006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn.</p><h3 id=p10006015_10-1>David and Michal</h3><p id=p10006015_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart. <b class=verse-num id=v10006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v10006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts <b class=verse-num id=v10006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed, each to his house.</p><p id=p10006019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v10006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, &#8220;How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants&#8217; female servants, as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And David said to Michal, &#8220;It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the LORD&#8212;and I will celebrate before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v10006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes. But by the female servants of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</p></div>

And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v10007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, <b class=verse-num id=v10007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. <b class=verse-num id=v10007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v10007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. <b class=verse-num id=v10007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, <b class=verse-num id=v10007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>but my steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. <b class=verse-num id=v10007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.</p><h3 id=p10007017_06-1>David&#8217;s Prayer of Gratitude</h3><p id=p10007017_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, &#8220;Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? <b class=verse-num id=v10007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD. You have spoken also of your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD! <b class=verse-num id=v10007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And what more can David say to you?

For there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <b class=verse-num id=v10007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name and doing for them great and awesome things by driving out before your people, whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, a nation and its gods? <b class=verse-num id=v10007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And you established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever. And you, O LORD, became their God. <b class=verse-num id=v10007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken. <b class=verse-num id=v10007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And your name will be magnified forever, saying, &#8216;The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,&#8217; and the house of your servant David will be established before you. <b class=verse-num id=v10007027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For you, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, &#8216;I will build you a house.&#8217; Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you. <b class=verse-num id=v10007028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v10007029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever.&#8221;</p></div>

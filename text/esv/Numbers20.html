Its skin, its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned. <b class=verse-num id=v04019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the priest shall take cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet yarn, and throw them into the fire burning the heifer. <b class=verse-num id=v04019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. But the priest shall be unclean until evening. <b class=verse-num id=v04019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The one who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening. <b class=verse-num id=v04019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place. And they shall be kept for the water for impurity for the congregation of the people of Israel; it is a sin offering. <b class=verse-num id=v04019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. And this shall be a perpetual statute for the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.</p><p id=p04019010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Whoever touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v04019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He shall cleanse himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean. But if he does not cleanse himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean. <b class=verse-num id=v04019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Whoever touches a dead person, the body of anyone who has died, and does not cleanse himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not thrown on him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is still on him.</p><p id=p04019013_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v04019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And every open vessel that has no cover fastened on it is unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v04019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Whoever in the open field touches someone who was killed with a sword or who died naturally, or touches a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v04019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the unclean they shall take some ashes of the burnt sin offering, and fresh water shall be added in a vessel. <b class=verse-num id=v04019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on whoever touched the bone, or the slain or the dead or the grave. <b class=verse-num id=v04019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the clean person shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day. Thus on the seventh day he shall cleanse him, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean.</p><p id=p04019019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v04019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;If the man who is unclean does not cleanse himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, since he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. Because the water for impurity has not been thrown on him, he is unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v04019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And it shall be a statute forever for them. The one who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and the one who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening. <b class=verse-num id=v04019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening.&#8221;</p></div>

And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <b class=verse-num id=v04020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the people quarreled with Moses and said, &#8220;Would that we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD! <b class=verse-num id=v04020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle? <b class=verse-num id=v04020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them, <b class=verse-num id=v04020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</p><h3 id=p04020009_09-1>Moses Strikes the Rock</h3><p id=p04020009_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, &#8220;Hear now, you rebels: shall we bring water for you out of this rock?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, and water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock. <b class=verse-num id=v04020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>These are the waters of Meribah, where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and through them he showed himself holy.</p><h3 id=p04020013_13-1>Edom Refuses Passage</h3><p id=p04020013_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: &#8220;Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that we have met: <b class=verse-num id=v04020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v04020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. <b class=verse-num id=v04020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from a well. We will go along the King&#8217;s Highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But Edom said to him, &#8220;You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel said to him, &#8220;We will go up by the highway, and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then I will pay for it.

And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall die there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Moses did as the LORD commanded. And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <b class=verse-num id=v04020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v04020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.</p></div>

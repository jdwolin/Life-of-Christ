<h3 id=p06022001_01-1>The Eastern Tribes Return Home</h3><p id=p06022001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>At that time Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, <b class=verse-num id=v06022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you. <b class=verse-num id=v06022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You have not forsaken your brothers these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God. <b class=verse-num id=v06022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them. Therefore turn and go to your tents in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v06022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.</p><p id=p06022006_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them, <b class=verse-num id=v06022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>he said to them, &#8220;Go back to your tents with much wealth and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the LORD through Moses.</p><h3 id=p06022009_06-1>The Eastern Tribes&#8217; Altar of Witness</h3><p id=p06022009_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of imposing size. <b class=verse-num id=v06022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel heard it said, &#8220;Behold, the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh to make war against them.</p><p id=p06022012_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Israel sent to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, <b class=verse-num id=v06022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they came to the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them, <b class=verse-num id=v06022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, &#8216;What is this breach of faith that you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the LORD by building yourselves an altar this day in rebellion against the LORD? <b class=verse-num id=v06022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Have we not had enough of the sin at Peor from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v06022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>that you too must turn away this day from following the LORD? And if you too rebel against the LORD today then tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But now, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over into the LORD&#8217;s land where the LORD&#8217;s tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD or make us as rebels by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God. <b class=verse-num id=v06022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p06022020_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Reuben, the people of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v06022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today <b class=verse-num id=v06022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD. Or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance. <b class=verse-num id=v06022024-1>24&nbsp;</b>No, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, &#8216;What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v06022025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you people of Reuben and people of Gad. You have no portion in the LORD.&#8217; So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06022026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Therefore we said, &#8216;Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, <b class=verse-num id=v06022027-1>27&nbsp;</b>but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, so your children will not say to our children in time to come, &#8220;You have no portion in the LORD.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And we thought, &#8216;If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, &#8220;Behold, the copy of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v06022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!&#8221;</p><p id=p06022029_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v06022031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the people of Reuben and the people of Gad and the people of Manasseh, &#8220;Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this breach of faith against the LORD. Now you have delivered the people of Israel from the hand of the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p06022031_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v06022032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the people of Reuben and the people of Gad in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them. <b class=verse-num id=v06022033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the report was good in the eyes of the people of Israel. And the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them to destroy the land where the people of Reuben and the people of Gad were settled. <b class=verse-num id=v06022034-1>34&nbsp;</b>The people of Reuben and the people of Gad called the altar Witness, &#8220;For,&#8221; they said, &#8220;it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p06024001_01-1>The Covenant Renewal at Shechem</h3><p id=p06024001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel. And they presented themselves before God. <b class=verse-num id=v06024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods. <b class=verse-num id=v06024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v06024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v06024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.</p><p id=p06024005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. <b class=verse-num id=v06024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time. <b class=verse-num id=v06024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. <b class=verse-num id=v06024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you, <b class=verse-num id=v06024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v06024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v06024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow. <b class=verse-num id=v06024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p06024013_06-1>Choose Whom You Will Serve</h3><p id=p06024013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.

And he took a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06024028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</p><h3 id=p06024028_11-1>Joshua&#8217;s Death and Burial</h3><p id=p06024028_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024029-1>29&nbsp;</b>After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being 110 years old. <b class=verse-num id=v06024030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And they buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.</p><p id=p06024030_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the LORD did for Israel.</p><p id=p06024031_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024032-1>32&nbsp;</b>As for the bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt, they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money.

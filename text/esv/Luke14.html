Why should it use up the ground?&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42013008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he answered him, &#8216;Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42013009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42013009_11-1>A Woman with a Disabling Spirit</h3><p id=p42013009_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v42013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. <b class=verse-num id=v42013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. <b class=verse-num id=v42013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, you are freed from your disability.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. <b class=verse-num id=v42013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, &#8220;There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the Lord answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42013016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.</p><h3 id=p42013017_17-1>The Mustard Seed and the Leaven</h3><p id=p42013017_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v42013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>He said therefore, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is the kingdom of God like?

For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42013025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, &#8216;Lord, open to us,&#8217; then he will answer you, &#8216;I do not know where you come from.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42013026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then you will begin to say, &#8216;We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42013027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But he will say, &#8216;I tell you, I do not know where you come from.

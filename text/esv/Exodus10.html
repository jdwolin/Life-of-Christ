<h3 id=p02009001_01-1>The Fifth Plague: Egyptian Livestock Die</h3><p id=p02009001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v02009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them, <b class=verse-num id=v02009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>behold, the hand of the LORD will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks. <b class=verse-num id=v02009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD set a time, saying, &#8220;Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the next day the LORD did this thing. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died. <b class=verse-num id=v02009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</p><h3 id=p02009007_07-1>The Sixth Plague: Boils</h3><p id=p02009007_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v02009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v02009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast. <b class=verse-num id=v02009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians. <b class=verse-num id=v02009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had spoken to Moses.</p><h3 id=p02009012_11-1>The Seventh Plague: Hail</h3><p id=p02009012_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v02009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself, and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go. <b class=verse-num id=v02009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. <b class=verse-num id=v02009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses, <b class=verse-num id=v02009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.</p><p id=p02009021_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v02009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. <b class=verse-num id=v02009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field. <b class=verse-num id=v02009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.</p><p id=p02009026_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v02009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, &#8220;This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. <b class=verse-num id=v02009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Plead with the LORD, for there has been enough of God&#8217;s thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Moses said to him, &#8220;As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v02009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>(The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud. <b class=verse-num id=v02009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But the wheat and the emmer were not struck down, for they are late in coming up.) <b class=verse-num id=v02009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v02009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v02009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.</p></div>

Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class=verse-num id=v02010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country, <b class=verse-num id=v02010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land. And they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field, <b class=verse-num id=v02010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and they shall fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.&#8217;&#8221; Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.</p><p id=p02010006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, &#8220;Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, &#8220;The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind. <b class=verse-num id=v02010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you are asking.&#8221; And they were driven out from Pharaoh&#8217;s presence.</p><p id=p02010011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts. <b class=verse-num id=v02010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again. <b class=verse-num id=v02010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v02010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, &#8220;I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. <b class=verse-num id=v02010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea.

I will not see your face again.&#8221;</p></div>

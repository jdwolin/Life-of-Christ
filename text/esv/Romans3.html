<h3 id=p45002001_01-1>God&#8217;s Righteous Judgment</h3><p id=p45002001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. <b class=verse-num id=v45002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. <b class=verse-num id=v45002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you suppose, O man&#8212;you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself&#8212;that you will escape the judgment of God? <b class=verse-num id=v45002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God&#8217;s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? <b class=verse-num id=v45002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God&#8217;s righteous judgment will be revealed.</p><p id=p45002005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He will render to each one according to his works: <b class=verse-num id=v45002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; <b class=verse-num id=v45002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. <b class=verse-num id=v45002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, <b class=verse-num id=v45002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v45002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For God shows no partiality.</p><h3 id=p45002011_04-1>God&#8217;s Judgment and the Law</h3><p id=p45002011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. <b class=verse-num id=v45002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them <b class=verse-num id=v45002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</p><p id=p45002016_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God <b class=verse-num id=v45002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; <b class=verse-num id=v45002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <b class=verse-num id=v45002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? <b class=verse-num id=v45002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <b class=verse-num id=v45002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For, as it is written, &#8220;The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.&#8221;</p><p id=p45002024_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. <b class=verse-num id=v45002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? <b class=verse-num id=v45002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. <b class=verse-num id=v45002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</p></div>

To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>What if some were unfaithful?

Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, <b class=verse-num id=v45003030-1>30&nbsp;</b>since God is one&#8212;who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. <b class=verse-num id=v45003031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</p></div>

For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v45004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, <b class=verse-num id=v45004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</p><h3 id=p45004012_05-1>The Promise Realized Through Faith</h3><p id=p45004012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. <b class=verse-num id=v45004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. <b class=verse-num id=v45004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</p><p id=p45004015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring&#8212;not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, <b class=verse-num id=v45004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>as it is written, &#8220;I have made you the father of many nations&#8221;&#8212;in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. <b class=verse-num id=v45004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, &#8220;So shall your offspring be.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah&#8217;s womb. <b class=verse-num id=v45004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, <b class=verse-num id=v45004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. <b class=verse-num id=v45004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>That is why his faith was &#8220;counted to him as righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the words &#8220;it was counted to him&#8221; were not written for his sake alone, <b class=verse-num id=v45004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but for ours also.

And his disciples came and begged him, saying, &#8220;Send her away, for she is crying out after us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But she came and knelt before him, saying, &#8220;Lord, help me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And he answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is not right to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>She said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus answered her, <span class=woc>&#8220;O woman, great is your faith!

And he went up on the mountain and sat down there. <b class=verse-num id=v40015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, <b class=verse-num id=v40015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.</p><h3 id=p40015031_17-1>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</h3><p id=p40015031_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v40015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the disciples said to him, &#8220;Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Seven, and a few small fish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground, <b class=verse-num id=v40015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v40015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. <b class=verse-num id=v40015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. <b class=verse-num id=v40015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.</p></div>

If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. <b class=verse-num id=v40017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Rise, and have no fear.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p><p id=p40017008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v40017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the disciples asked him, &#8220;Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40017012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased.

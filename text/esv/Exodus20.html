There Israel encamped before the mountain, <b class=verse-num id=v02019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>while Moses went up to God. The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel: <b class=verse-num id=v02019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8216;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&#8217; wings and brought you to myself. <b class=verse-num id=v02019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine; <b class=verse-num id=v02019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8217; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him. <b class=verse-num id=v02019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>All the people answered together and said, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do.&#8221; And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019009_05-1>When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD, <b class=verse-num id=v02019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments <b class=verse-num id=v02019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. <b class=verse-num id=v02019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, &#8216;Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v02019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; whether beast or man, he shall not live.&#8217; When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v02019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people, &#8220;Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.&#8221;</p><p id=p02019015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. <b class=verse-num id=v02019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v02019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. <b class=verse-num id=v02019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. <b class=verse-num id=v02019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</p><p id=p02019020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to look and many of them perish. <b class=verse-num id=v02019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to the LORD, &#8220;The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, &#8216;Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to him, &#8220;Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So Moses went down to the people and told them.</p></div>

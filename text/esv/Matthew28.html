<h3 id=p40027001_01-1>Jesus Delivered to Pilate</h3><p id=p40027001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v40027001-1>27:1&nbsp;</b>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. <b class=verse-num id=v40027002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.</p><h3 id=p40027002_05-1>Judas Hangs Himself</h3><p id=p40027002_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, <b class=verse-num id=v40027004-1>4&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What is that to us? See to it yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. <b class=verse-num id=v40027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, &#8220;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field as a burial place for strangers. <b class=verse-num id=v40027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v40027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, &#8220;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v40027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and they gave them for the potter&#8217;s field, as the Lord directed me.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40027010_08-1>Jesus Before Pilate</h3><p id=p40027010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. <b class=verse-num id=v40027013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p><h3 id=p40027014_11-1>The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</h3><p id=p40027014_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. <b class=verse-num id=v40027016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. <b class=verse-num id=v40027017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, &#8220;Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. <b class=verse-num id=v40027019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, &#8220;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v40027021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The governor again said to them, &#8220;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Barabbas.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; They all said, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Why? What evil has he done?&#8221; But they shouted all the more, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40027023_15-1>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</h3><p id=p40027023_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &#8220;I am innocent of this man&#8217;s blood; see to it yourselves.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And all the people answered, &#8220;His blood be on us and on our children!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</p><h3 id=p40027026_21-1>Jesus Is Mocked</h3><p id=p40027026_24-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor&#8217;s headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. <b class=verse-num id=v40027028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <b class=verse-num id=v40027029-1>29&nbsp;</b>and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. <b class=verse-num id=v40027031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.</p><h3 id=p40027031_24-1>The Crucifixion</h3><p id=p40027031_26-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027032-1>32&nbsp;</b>As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. <b class=verse-num id=v40027033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), <b class=verse-num id=v40027034-1>34&nbsp;</b>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. <b class=verse-num id=v40027035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. <b class=verse-num id=v40027036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. <b class=verse-num id=v40027037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, &#8220;This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. <b class=verse-num id=v40027039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads <b class=verse-num id=v40027040-1>40&nbsp;</b>and saying, &#8220;You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027041-1>41&nbsp;</b>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v40027042-1>42&nbsp;</b>&#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <b class=verse-num id=v40027043-1>43&nbsp;</b>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, &#8216;I am the Son of God.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027044-1>44&nbsp;</b>And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</p><h3 id=p40027044_26-1>The Death of Jesus</h3><p id=p40027044_30-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. <b class=verse-num id=v40027046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&#8221;</span> that is, <span class=woc>&#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40027047-1>47&nbsp;</b>And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, &#8220;This man is calling Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027048-1>48&nbsp;</b>And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. <b class=verse-num id=v40027049-1>49&nbsp;</b>But the others said, &#8220;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027050-1>50&nbsp;</b>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</p><p id=p40027050_30-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027051-1>51&nbsp;</b>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. <b class=verse-num id=v40027052-1>52&nbsp;</b>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, <b class=verse-num id=v40027053-1>53&nbsp;</b>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. <b class=verse-num id=v40027054-1>54&nbsp;</b>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221;</p><p id=p40027054_30-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027055-1>55&nbsp;</b>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, <b class=verse-num id=v40027056-1>56&nbsp;</b>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p><h3 id=p40027056_30-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p40027056_33-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027057-1>57&nbsp;</b>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v40027058-1>58&nbsp;</b>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <b class=verse-num id=v40027059-1>59&nbsp;</b>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud <b class=verse-num id=v40027060-1>60&nbsp;</b>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. <b class=verse-num id=v40027061-1>61&nbsp;</b>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p><h3 id=p40027061_33-1>The Guard at the Tomb</h3><p id=p40027061_38-1><b class=verse-num id=v40027062-1>62&nbsp;</b>The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate <b class=verse-num id=v40027063-1>63&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, &#8216;After three days I will rise.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v40027064-1>64&nbsp;</b>Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, &#8216;He has risen from the dead,&#8217; and the last fraud will be worse than the first.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027065-1>65&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, &#8220;You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40027066-1>66&nbsp;</b>So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</p></div>

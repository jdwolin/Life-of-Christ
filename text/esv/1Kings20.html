And he asked that he might die, saying, &#8220;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, &#8220;Arise and eat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. <b class=verse-num id=v11019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, &#8220;Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.</p><h3 id=p11019008_04-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Speaks to Elijah</h3><p id=p11019008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v11019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, &#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Go out and stand on the mount before the LORD.&#8221; And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <b class=verse-num id=v11019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. <b class=verse-num id=v11019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, &#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to him, &#8220;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. <b class=verse-num id=v11019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. <b class=verse-num id=v11019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death. <b class=verse-num id=v11019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p11019018_09-1>The Call of Elisha</h3><p id=p11019018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v11019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him. <b class=verse-num id=v11019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, &#8220;Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Go back again, for what have I done to you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.</p></div>

Thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and closed in on Samaria and fought against it. <b class=verse-num id=v11020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Ben-hadad: <b class=verse-num id=v11020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Your silver and your gold are mine; your best wives and children also are mine.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel answered, &#8220;As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The messengers came again and said, &#8220;Thus says Ben-hadad: &#8216;I sent to you, saying, &#8220;Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p11020006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, &#8220;Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And all the elders and all the people said to him, &#8220;Do not listen or consent.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, &#8220;Tell my lord the king, &#8216;All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this thing I cannot do.&#8217;&#8221; And the messengers departed and brought him word again. <b class=verse-num id=v11020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Ben-hadad sent to him and said, &#8220;The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel answered, &#8220;Tell him, &#8216;Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, &#8220;Take your positions.&#8221; And they took their positions against the city.</p><h3 id=p11020012_05-1>Ahab Defeats Ben-hadad</h3><p id=p11020012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand this day, and you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said, &#8220;By whom?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, By the servants of the governors of the districts.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Who shall begin the battle?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;You.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts, and they were 232. And after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand.</p><p id=p11020015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him. <b class=verse-num id=v11020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The servants of the governors of the districts went out first.

The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen. <b class=verse-num id=v11020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great blow.</p><p id=p11020021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, &#8220;Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do, for in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you.&#8221;</p><p id=p11020022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, &#8220;Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. <b class=verse-num id=v11020024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places, <b class=verse-num id=v11020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.&#8221; And he listened to their voice and did so.</p><h3 id=p11020025_08-1>Ahab Defeats Ben-hadad Again</h3><p id=p11020025_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>In the spring, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v11020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them. The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country. <b class=verse-num id=v11020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because the Syrians have said, &#8220;The LORD is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys,&#8221; therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined. And the people of Israel struck down of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day. <b class=verse-num id=v11020030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the rest fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell upon 27,000 men who were left.</p><p id=p11020030_12-1>Ben-hadad also fled and entered an inner chamber in the city. <b class=verse-num id=v11020031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And his servants said to him, &#8220;Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So they tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said, &#8220;Your servant Ben-hadad says, &#8216;Please, let me live.&#8217;&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Does he still live? He is my brother.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now the men were watching for a sign, and they quickly took it up from him and said, &#8220;Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Go and bring him.&#8221; Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot. <b class=verse-num id=v11020034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Ben-hadad said to him, &#8220;The cities that my father took from your father I will restore, and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.&#8221; And Ahab said, &#8220;I will let you go on these terms.&#8221; So he made a covenant with him and let him go.</p><h3 id=p11020034_12-1>A Prophet Condemns Ben-hadad&#8217;s Release</h3><p id=p11020034_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v11020035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the LORD, &#8220;Strike me, please.&#8221; But the man refused to strike him. <b class=verse-num id=v11020036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Then he said to him, &#8220;Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down.&#8221; And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and struck him down. <b class=verse-num id=v11020037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Then he found another man and said, &#8220;Strike me, please.&#8221; And the man struck him&#8212;struck him and wounded him. <b class=verse-num id=v11020038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v11020039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, &#8220;Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said, &#8216;Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11020040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.&#8221; The king of Israel said to him, &#8220;So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v11020042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11020043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria.</p></div>

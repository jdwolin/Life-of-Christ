<h3 id=p48001001_01-1>Greeting</h3><p id=p48001001_02-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>Paul, an apostle&#8212;not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and all the brothers who are with me,</p><p id=p48001002_02-1>To the churches of Galatia:</p><p id=p48001002_02-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v48001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, <b class=verse-num id=v48001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><h3 id=p48001005_02-1>No Other Gospel</h3><p id=p48001005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. <b class=verse-num id=v48001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</p><p id=p48001009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p><h3 id=p48001010_05-1>Paul Called by God</h3><p id=p48001010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man&#8217;s gospel. <b class=verse-num id=v48001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. <b class=verse-num id=v48001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v48001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, <b class=verse-num id=v48001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; <b class=verse-num id=v48001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</p><p id=p48001017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. <b class=verse-num id=v48001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord&#8217;s brother. <b class=verse-num id=v48001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) <b class=verse-num id=v48001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <b class=verse-num id=v48001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>They only were hearing it said, &#8220;He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they glorified God because of me.</p></div>

<h3 id=p48002001_01-1>Paul Accepted by the Apostles</h3><p id=p48002001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those who seemed influential) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain. <b class=verse-num id=v48002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v48002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in&#8212;who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. <b class=verse-num id=v48002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)&#8212;those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised <b class=verse-num id=v48002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>(for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), <b class=verse-num id=v48002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v48002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</p><h3 id=p48002010_06-1>Paul Opposes Peter</h3><p id=p48002010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. <b class=verse-num id=v48002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. <b class=verse-num id=v48002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. <b class=verse-num id=v48002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, &#8220;If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p48002014_09-1>Justified by Faith</h3><p id=p48002014_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v48002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; <b class=verse-num id=v48002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.</p><p id=p48002016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v48002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! <b class=verse-num id=v48002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. <b class=verse-num id=v48002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. <b class=verse-num id=v48002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.</p></div>

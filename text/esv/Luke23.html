Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. <b class=verse-num id=v42023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</p><p id=p42023012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v42023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <b class=verse-num id=v42023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people.

Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, <b class=verse-num id=v42024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And they remembered his words, <b class=verse-num id=v42024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. <b class=verse-num id=v42024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, <b class=verse-num id=v42024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p><h3 id=p42024012_03-1>On the Road to Emmaus</h3><p id=p42024012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v42024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <b class=verse-num id=v42024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <b class=verse-num id=v42024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#8221;</span> And they stood still, looking sad. <b class=verse-num id=v42024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#8220;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <b class=verse-num id=v42024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <b class=verse-num id=v42024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <b class=verse-num id=v42024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <b class=verse-num id=v42024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <b class=verse-num id=v42024024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p><p id=p42024027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <b class=verse-num id=v42024029-1>29&nbsp;</b>but they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024030-1>30&nbsp;</b>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <b class=verse-num id=v42024031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <b class=verse-num id=v42024032-1>32&nbsp;</b>They said to each other, &#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <b class=verse-num id=v42024034-1>34&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42024035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p><h3 id=p42024035_08-1>Jesus Appears to His Disciples</h3><p id=p42024035_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42024036-1>36&nbsp;</b>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Peace to you!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42024037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <b class=verse-num id=v42024038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42024039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.

<h3 id=p10017001_01-1>Hushai Saves David</h3><p id=p10017001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10017001-1>17:1&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Ahithophel said to Absalom, &#8220;Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. <b class=verse-num id=v10017002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged and throw him into a panic, and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king, <b class=verse-num id=v10017003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.</p><p id=p10017004_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, &#8220;Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, &#8220;Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he says? If not, you speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Hushai said to Absalom, &#8220;This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Hushai said, &#8220;You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people. <b class=verse-num id=v10017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And as soon as some of the people fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, &#8216;There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men. <b class=verse-num id=v10017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. <b class=verse-num id=v10017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and all the men with him not one will be left. <b class=verse-num id=v10017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, &#8220;The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.&#8221; For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring harm upon Absalom.</p><p id=p10017014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, &#8220;Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so have I counseled. <b class=verse-num id=v10017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send quickly and tell David, &#8216;Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel. A female servant was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they were not to be seen entering the city. <b class=verse-num id=v10017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. And they went down into it. <b class=verse-num id=v10017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well&#8217;s mouth and scattered grain on it, and nothing was known of it. <b class=verse-num id=v10017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>When Absalom&#8217;s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, &#8220;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&#8221; And the woman said to them, &#8220;They have gone over the brook of water.&#8221; And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p10017020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, &#8220;Arise, and go quickly over the water, for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</p><p id=p10017022_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.</p><p id=p10017023_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v10017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had married Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s mother. <b class=verse-num id=v10017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</p><p id=p10017026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, <b class=verse-num id=v10017028-1>28&nbsp;</b>brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils, <b class=verse-num id=v10017029-1>29&nbsp;</b>honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat, for they said, &#8220;The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p10018001_01-1>Absalom Killed</h3><p id=p10018001_03-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. <b class=verse-num id=v10018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, &#8220;I myself will also go out with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the men said, &#8220;You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The king said to them, &#8220;Whatever seems best to you I will do.&#8221; So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. <b class=verse-num id=v10018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, &#8220;Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.&#8221; And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.</p><p id=p10018005_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. <b class=verse-num id=v10018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men. <b class=verse-num id=v10018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.</p><p id=p10018008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on. <b class=verse-num id=v10018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And a certain man saw it and told Joab, &#8220;Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Joab said to the man who told him, &#8220;What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the man said to Joab, &#8220;Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king&#8217;s son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, &#8216;For my sake protect the young man Absalom.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Joab said, &#8220;I will not waste time like this with you.&#8221; And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak. <b class=verse-num id=v10018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And ten young men, Joab&#8217;s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.</p><p id=p10018015_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them. <b class=verse-num id=v10018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home. <b class=verse-num id=v10018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King&#8217;s Valley, for he said, &#8220;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.&#8221; He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom&#8217;s monument to this day.</p><h3 id=p10018018_03-1>David Hears of Absalom&#8217;s Death</h3><p id=p10018018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, &#8220;Let me run and carry news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Joab said to him, &#8220;You are not to carry news today. You may carry news another day, but today you shall carry no news, because the king&#8217;s son is dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Joab said to the Cushite, &#8220;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&#8221; The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran. <b class=verse-num id=v10018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, &#8220;Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite.&#8221; And Joab said, &#8220;Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Come what may,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will run.&#8221; So he said to him, &#8220;Run.&#8221; Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.</p><p id=p10018023_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone. <b class=verse-num id=v10018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, &#8220;If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.&#8221; And he drew nearer and nearer. <b class=verse-num id=v10018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gate and said, &#8220;See, another man running alone!&#8221; The king said, &#8220;He also brings news.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The watchman said, &#8220;I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.&#8221; And the king said, &#8220;He is a good man and comes with good news.&#8221;</p><p id=p10018027_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, &#8220;All is well.&#8221; And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Is it well with the young man Absalom?&#8221; Ahimaaz answered, &#8220;When Joab sent the king&#8217;s servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what it was.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Turn aside and stand here.&#8221; So he turned aside and stood still.</p><h3 id=p10018030_08-1>David&#8217;s Grief</h3><p id=p10018030_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v10018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And behold, the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, &#8220;Good news for my lord the king! For the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The king said to the Cushite, &#8220;Is it well with the young man Absalom?&#8221; And the Cushite answered, &#8220;May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, he said, &#8220;O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!&#8221;</p></div>

For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you, for today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased. <b class=verse-num id=v10019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the king arose and took his seat in the gate. And the people were all told, &#8220;Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.&#8221; And all the people came before the king.</p><h3 id=p10019008_04-1>David Returns to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10019008_08-1>Now Israel had fled every man to his own home. <b class=verse-num id=v10019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And all the people were arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &#8220;The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. <b class=verse-num id=v10019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.

I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Mephibosheth said to the king, &#8220;Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home.&#8221;</p><p id=p10019030_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v10019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. <b class=verse-num id=v10019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the king said to Barzillai, &#8220;Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But Barzillai said to the king, &#8220;How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? <b class=verse-num id=v10019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? <b class=verse-num id=v10019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward? <b class=verse-num id=v10019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do for him whatever seems good to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And the king answered, &#8220;Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home. <b class=verse-num id=v10019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.</p><p id=p10019040_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v10019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, &#8220;Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David&#8217;s men with him?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019042-1>42&nbsp;</b>All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, &#8220;Because the king is our close relative. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king&#8217;s expense? Or has he given us any gift?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10019043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, &#8220;We have ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?&#8221; But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</p></div>

<h3 id=p59004001_01-1>Warning Against Worldliness</h3><p id=p59004001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v59004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? <b class=verse-num id=v59004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. <b class=verse-num id=v59004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. <b class=verse-num id=v59004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. <b class=verse-num id=v59004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, &#8220;He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v59004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v59004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <b class=verse-num id=v59004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. <b class=verse-num id=v59004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. <b class=verse-num id=v59004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p><p id=p59004010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v59004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. <b class=verse-num id=v59004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</p><h3 id=p59004012_04-1>Boasting About Tomorrow</h3><p id=p59004012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v59004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Come now, you who say, &#8220;Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v59004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. <b class=verse-num id=v59004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Instead you ought to say, &#8220;If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v59004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. <b class=verse-num id=v59004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.</p></div>

Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. <b class=verse-num id=v59005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door. <b class=verse-num id=v59005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v59005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.</p><p id=p59005011_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v59005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your &#8220;yes&#8221; be yes and your &#8220;no&#8221; be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.</p><h3 id=p59005012_08-1>The Prayer of Faith</h3><p id=p59005012_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v59005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Is anyone among you suffering?

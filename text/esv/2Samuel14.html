<h3 id=p10013001_01-1>Amnon and Tamar</h3><p id=p10013001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10013001-1>13:1&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom, David&#8217;s son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David&#8217;s son, loved her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man. <b class=verse-num id=v10013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?&#8221; Amnon said to him, &#8220;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Jonadab said to him, &#8220;Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, &#8216;Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &#8220;Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p10013006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, &#8220;Go to your brother Amnon&#8217;s house and prepare food for him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#8217;s house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes. <b class=verse-num id=v10013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, &#8220;Send out everyone from me.&#8221; So everyone went out from him. <b class=verse-num id=v10013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Amnon said to Tamar, &#8220;Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.&#8221; And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <b class=verse-num id=v10013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &#8220;Come, lie with me, my sister.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>She answered him, &#8220;No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing. <b class=verse-num id=v10013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.</p><p id=p10013014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, &#8220;Get up! Go!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But she said to him, &#8220;No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.&#8221; But he would not listen to her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He called the young man who served him and said, &#8220;Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. <b class=verse-num id=v10013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.</p><p id=p10013019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And her brother Absalom said to her, &#8220;Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart.&#8221; So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v10013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. <b class=verse-num id=v10013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.</p><h3 id=p10013022_04-1>Absalom Murders Amnon</h3><p id=p10013022_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king&#8217;s sons. <b class=verse-num id=v10013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Absalom came to the king and said, &#8220;Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But the king said to Absalom, &#8220;No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.&#8221; He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing. <b class=verse-num id=v10013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, &#8220;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&#8221; And the king said to him, &#8220;Why should he go with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king&#8217;s sons go with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom commanded his servants, &#8220;Mark when Amnon&#8217;s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, &#8216;Strike Amnon,&#8217; then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&#8217;s sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.</p><p id=p10013029_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>While they were on the way, news came to David, &#8220;Absalom has struck down all the king&#8217;s sons, and not one of them is left.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v10013032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother, said, &#8220;Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king&#8217;s sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar. <b class=verse-num id=v10013033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king&#8217;s sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p10013033_07-1>Absalom Flees to Geshur</h3><p id=p10013033_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v10013035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And Jonadab said to the king, &#8220;Behold, the king&#8217;s sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10013036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king&#8217;s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.</p><p id=p10013036_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v10013037-1>37&nbsp;</b>But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day. <b class=verse-num id=v10013038-1>38&nbsp;</b>So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years. <b class=verse-num id=v10013039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.</p></div>

<h3 id=p10014001_01-1>Absalom Returns to Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10014001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v10014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king&#8217;s heart went out to Absalom. <b class=verse-num id=v10014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, &#8220;Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v10014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Go to the king and speak thus to him.&#8221; So Joab put the words in her mouth.</p><p id=p10014003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, &#8220;Save me, O king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is your trouble?&#8221; She answered, &#8220;Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead. <b class=verse-num id=v10014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him. <b class=verse-num id=v10014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, &#8216;Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.&#8217; And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.&#8221;</p><p id=p10014007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to the woman, &#8220;Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, &#8220;On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father&#8217;s house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The king said, &#8220;If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then she said, &#8220;Please let the king invoke the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.&#8221;</p><p id=p10014011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the woman said, &#8220;Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the woman said, &#8220;Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again. <b class=verse-num id=v10014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast. <b class=verse-num id=v10014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, &#8216;I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. <b class=verse-num id=v10014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v10014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And your servant thought, &#8216;The word of my lord the king will set me at rest,&#8217; for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!&#8221;</p><p id=p10014017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then the king answered the woman, &#8220;Do not hide from me anything I ask you.&#8221; And the woman said, &#8220;Let my lord the king speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The king said, &#8220;Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?&#8221; The woman answered and said, &#8220;As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v10014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.&#8221;</p><p id=p10014020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Joab, &#8220;Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, &#8220;Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v10014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the king said, &#8220;Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence.&#8221; So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king&#8217;s presence.</p><p id=p10014024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <b class=verse-num id=v10014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king&#8217;s weight. <b class=verse-num id=v10014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.</p><p id=p10014027_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v10014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king&#8217;s presence. <b class=verse-num id=v10014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come. <b class=verse-num id=v10014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then he said to his servants, &#8220;See, Joab&#8217;s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.&#8221; So Absalom&#8217;s servants set the field on fire. <b class=verse-num id=v10014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, &#8220;Why have your servants set my field on fire?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Absalom answered Joab, &#8220;Behold, I sent word to you, &#8216;Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, &#8220;Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.&#8221; Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.</p></div>

And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, &#8220;From what city are you?&#8221; And when he said, &#8220;Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Absalom would say to him, &#8220;See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom would say, &#8220;Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. <b class=verse-num id=v10015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p><p id=p10015006_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, &#8220;Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron. <b class=verse-num id=v10015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, &#8216;If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The king said to him, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; So he arose and went to Hebron. <b class=verse-num id=v10015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &#8220;As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, &#8216;Absalom is king at Hebron!&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing. <b class=verse-num id=v10015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&#8217;s counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.</p><h3 id=p10015012_03-1>David Flees Jerusalem</h3><p id=p10015012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And a messenger came to David, saying, &#8220;The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, &#8220;Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the king&#8217;s servants said to the king, &#8220;Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house. <b class=verse-num id=v10015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the king went out, and all the people after him.

Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But Ittai answered the king, &#8220;As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David said to Ittai, &#8220;Go then, pass on.&#8221; So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v10015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.</p><p id=p10015023_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city. <b class=verse-num id=v10015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to Zadok, &#8220;Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place. <b class=verse-num id=v10015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But if he says, &#8216;I have no pleasure in you,&#8217; behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The king also said to Zadok the priest, &#8220;Are you not a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. <b class=verse-num id=v10015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.</p><p id=p10015029_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went. <b class=verse-num id=v10015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And it was told David, &#8220;Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.&#8221; And David said, &#8220;O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.&#8221;</p><p id=p10015031_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v10015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head. <b class=verse-num id=v10015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>David said to him, &#8220;If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. <b class=verse-num id=v10015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, &#8216;I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father&#8217;s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,&#8217; then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. <b class=verse-num id=v10015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king&#8217;s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. <b class=verse-num id=v10015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok&#8217;s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar&#8217;s son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v10015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>So Hushai, David&#8217;s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.</p></div>

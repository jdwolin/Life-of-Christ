And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, <b class=verse-num id=v41010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41010034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him.

<h3 id=p17004001_01-1>Esther Agrees to Help the Jews</h3><p id=p17004001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v17004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry. <b class=verse-num id=v17004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He went up to the entrance of the king&#8217;s gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king&#8217;s gate clothed in sackcloth. <b class=verse-num id=v17004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And in every province, wherever the king&#8217;s command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p><p id=p17004003_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v17004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When Esther&#8217;s young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. <b class=verse-num id=v17004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was. <b class=verse-num id=v17004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king&#8217;s gate, <b class=verse-num id=v17004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king&#8217;s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people. <b class=verse-num id=v17004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. <b class=verse-num id=v17004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say, <b class=verse-num id=v17004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;All the king&#8217;s servants and the people of the king&#8217;s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law&#8212;to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.&#8221;</p><p id=p17004011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v17004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. <b class=verse-num id=v17004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, &#8220;Do not think to yourself that in the king&#8217;s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. <b class=verse-num id=v17004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&#8217;s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, <b class=verse-num id=v17004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.</p></div>

Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. <b class=verse-num id=v17005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Esther said, &#8220;If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the king said, &#8220;Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked.&#8221; So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared. <b class=verse-num id=v17005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Esther answered, &#8220;My wish and my request is: <b class=verse-num id=v17005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p17005008_05-1>Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai</h3><p id=p17005008_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v17005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#8217;s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. <b class=verse-num id=v17005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh. <b class=verse-num id=v17005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Haman said, &#8220;Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. <b class=verse-num id=v17005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#8217;s gate.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#8220;Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast.&#8221; This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.</p></div>

Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v17006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, &#8220;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.&#8221;</p><p id=p17006011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v17006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Mordecai returned to the king&#8217;s gate.

<h3 id=p06005001_01-1>The New Generation Circumcised</h3><p id=p06005001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06005001-1>5:1&nbsp;</b>As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.</p><p id=p06005001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005002-1>2&nbsp;</b>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. <b class=verse-num id=v06005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v06005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v06005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD; the LORD swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. <b class=verse-num id=v06005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</p><p id=p06005007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. <b class=verse-num id=v06005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#8221; And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.</p><h3 id=p06005009_05-1>First Passover in Canaan</h3><p id=p06005009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho. <b class=verse-num id=v06005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. <b class=verse-num id=v06005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p><h3 id=p06005012_09-1>The Commander of the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span>&#8217;s Army</h3><p id=p06005012_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v06005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, &#8220;Are you for us, or for our adversaries?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD. Now I have come.&#8221; And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to him, &#8220;What does my lord say to his servant?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the commander of the LORD&#8217;s army said to Joshua, &#8220;Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.&#8221; And Joshua did so.</p></div>

<h3 id=p06006001_01-1>The Fall of Jericho</h3><p id=p06006001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in. <b class=verse-num id=v06006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor. <b class=verse-num id=v06006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days. <b class=verse-num id=v06006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. <b class=verse-num id=v06006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when they make a long blast with the ram&#8217;s horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And he said to the people, &#8220;Go forward. March around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p06006007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them. <b class=verse-num id=v06006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually. <b class=verse-num id=v06006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Joshua commanded the people, &#8220;You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.</p><p id=p06006011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually. <b class=verse-num id=v06006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.</p><p id=p06006014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. <b class=verse-num id=v06006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, &#8220;Shout, for the LORD has given you the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. <b class=verse-num id=v06006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it. <b class=verse-num id=v06006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city. <b class=verse-num id=v06006021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.</p><p id=p06006021_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, &#8220;Go into the prostitute&#8217;s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06006023-1>23&nbsp;</b>So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v06006024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06006025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But Rahab the prostitute and her father&#8217;s household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p><p id=p06006025_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, &#8220;Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho.</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;At the cost of his firstborn shall he</span><br /><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lay its foundation,</span><br /><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and at the cost of his youngest son</span><br /><span id=p06006026_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall he set up its gates.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p06006026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06006027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.</p></div>

<h3 id=p06007001_01-1>Israel Defeated at Ai</h3><p id=p06007001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel.</p><p id=p06007001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, &#8220;Go up and spy out the land.&#8221; And the men went up and spied out Ai. <b class=verse-num id=v06007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, &#8220;Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So about three thousand men went up there from the people. And they fled before the men of Ai, <b class=verse-num id=v06007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.</p><p id=p06007005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v06007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads. <b class=verse-num id=v06007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, &#8220;Alas, O Lord GOD, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan! <b class=verse-num id=v06007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! <b class=verse-num id=v06007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p06007009_05-1>The Sin of Achan</h3><p id=p06007009_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Joshua, &#8220;Get up! Why have you fallen on your face? <b class=verse-num id=v06007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings. <b class=verse-num id=v06007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you. <b class=verse-num id=v06007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Get up! Consecrate the people and say, &#8216;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, &#8220;There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by man. <b class=verse-num id=v06007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p06007015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken. <b class=verse-num id=v06007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. <b class=verse-num id=v06007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. <b class=verse-num id=v06007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said to Achan, &#8220;My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and give praise to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Achan answered Joshua, &#8220;Truly I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did: <b class=verse-num id=v06007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath.&#8221;</p><p id=p06007021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v06007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath. <b class=verse-num id=v06007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor. <b class=verse-num id=v06007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, &#8220;Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today.&#8221; And all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones. <b class=verse-num id=v06007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.</p></div>

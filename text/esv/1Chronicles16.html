And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. <b class=verse-num id=v13015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him forever. <b class=verse-num id=v13015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it. <b class=verse-num id=v13015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: <b class=verse-num id=v13015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v13015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v13015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v13015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v13015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers; <b class=verse-num id=v13015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers. <b class=verse-num id=v13015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, <b class=verse-num id=v13015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;You are the heads of the fathers&#8217; houses of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it. <b class=verse-num id=v13015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v13015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p><p id=p13015015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v13015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy. <b class=verse-num id=v13015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; <b class=verse-num id=v13015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. <b class=verse-num id=v13015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals; <b class=verse-num id=v13015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth; <b class=verse-num id=v13015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith. <b class=verse-num id=v13015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it. <b class=verse-num id=v13015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. <b class=verse-num id=v13015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.</p><p id=p13015024_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v13015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing. <b class=verse-num id=v13015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. <b class=verse-num id=v13015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod. <b class=verse-num id=v13015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.</p><p id=p13015028_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v13015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.</p></div>

And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly, <b class=verse-num id=v13017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house. <b class=verse-num id=v13017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v13017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. <b class=verse-num id=v13017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, <b class=verse-num id=v13017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.</p><h3 id=p13017015_06-1>David&#8217;s Prayer</h3><p id=p13017015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v13017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, &#8220;Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? <b class=verse-num id=v13017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God. You have also spoken of your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, O LORD God! <b class=verse-num id=v13017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v13017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For your servant&#8217;s sake, O LORD, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. <b class=verse-num id=v13017020-1>20&nbsp;</b>There is none like you, O LORD, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <b class=verse-num id=v13017021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and awesome things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt? <b class=verse-num id=v13017022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And you made your people Israel to be your people forever, and you, O LORD, became their God. <b class=verse-num id=v13017023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken, <b class=verse-num id=v13017024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, &#8216;The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel&#8217;s God,&#8217; and the house of your servant David will be established before you. <b class=verse-num id=v13017025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. <b class=verse-num id=v13017026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And now, O LORD, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v13017027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O LORD, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever.&#8221;</p></div>

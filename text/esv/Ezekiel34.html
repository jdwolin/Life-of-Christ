<h3 id=p26033001_01-1>Ezekiel Is Israel&#8217;s Watchman</h3><p id=p26033001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26033001-1>33:1&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26033002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman, <b class=verse-num id=v26033003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people, <b class=verse-num id=v26033004-1>4&nbsp;</b>then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. <b class=verse-num id=v26033005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life. <b class=verse-num id=v26033006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman&#8217;s hand.</p><p id=p26033006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. <b class=verse-num id=v26033008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v26033009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.</p><h3 id=p26033009_05-1>Why Will You Die, Israel?</h3><p id=p26033009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: &#8216;Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we rot away because of them. How then can we live?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26033011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?</p><p id=p26033011_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness, and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness when he sins. <b class=verse-num id=v26033013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he trusts in his righteousness and does injustice, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his injustice that he has done he shall die. <b class=verse-num id=v26033014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Again, though I say to the wicked, &#8216;You shall surely die,&#8217; yet if he turns from his sin and does what is just and right, <b class=verse-num id=v26033015-1>15&nbsp;</b>if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by robbery, and walks in the statutes of life, not doing injustice, he shall surely live; he shall not die. <b class=verse-num id=v26033016-1>16&nbsp;</b>None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he shall surely live.</p><p id=p26033016_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Yet your people say, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not just,&#8217; when it is their own way that is not just. <b class=verse-num id=v26033018-1>18&nbsp;</b>When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it. <b class=verse-num id=v26033019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he shall live by this. <b class=verse-num id=v26033020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Yet you say, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not just.&#8217; O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26033020_10-1>Jerusalem Struck Down</h3><p id=p26033020_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033021-1>21&nbsp;</b>In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and said, &#8220;The city has been struck down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v26033022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning, so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.</p><p id=p26033022_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26033024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, &#8216;Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26033025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood and lift up your eyes to your idols and shed blood; shall you then possess the land? <b class=verse-num id=v26033026-1>26&nbsp;</b>You rely on the sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor&#8217;s wife; shall you then possess the land? <b class=verse-num id=v26033027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence. <b class=verse-num id=v26033028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and her proud might shall come to an end, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through. <b class=verse-num id=v26033029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.</p><p id=p26033029_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v26033030-1>30&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, son of man, your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to his brother, &#8216;Come, and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26033031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with lustful talk in their mouths they act; their heart is set on their gain. <b class=verse-num id=v26033032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And behold, you are to them like one who sings lustful songs with a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear what you say, but they will not do it. <b class=verse-num id=v26033033-1>33&nbsp;</b>When this comes&#8212;and come it will!&#8212;then they will know that a prophet has been among them.&#8221;</p></div>

Should not shepherds feed the sheep? <b class=verse-num id=v26034003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v26034004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them. <b class=verse-num id=v26034005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered; <b class=verse-num id=v26034006-1>6&nbsp;</b>they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them.</p><p id=p26034006_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v26034007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: <b class=verse-num id=v26034008-1>8&nbsp;</b>As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep, <b class=verse-num id=v26034009-1>9&nbsp;</b>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: <b class=verse-num id=v26034010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.</p><h3 id=p26034010_07-1>The Lord <span class=divine-name>God</span> Will Seek Them Out</h3><p id=p26034010_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v26034011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out. <b class=verse-num id=v26034012-1>12&nbsp;</b>As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. <b class=verse-num id=v26034013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country. <b class=verse-num id=v26034014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v26034015-1>15&nbsp;</b>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26034016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.</p><p id=p26034016_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v26034017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats. <b class=verse-num id=v26034018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet? <b class=verse-num id=v26034019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?</p><p id=p26034019_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v26034020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v26034021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad, <b class=verse-num id=v26034022-1>22&nbsp;</b>I will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v26034023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. <b class=verse-num id=v26034024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them.

And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them. <b class=verse-num id=v26034028-1>28&nbsp;</b>They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v26034029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And I will provide for them renowned plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations. <b class=verse-num id=v26034030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And they shall know that I am the LORD their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26034031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p></div>

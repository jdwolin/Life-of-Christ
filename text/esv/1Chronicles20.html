<h3 id=p13019001_01-1>The Ammonites Disgrace David&#8217;s Men</h3><p id=p13019001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v13019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v13019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me.&#8221; So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David&#8217;s servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, &#8220;Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Hanun took David&#8217;s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away; <b class=verse-num id=v13019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, &#8220;Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.&#8221;</p><p id=p13019005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. <b class=verse-num id=v13019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle. <b class=verse-num id=v13019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. <b class=verse-num id=v13019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</p><h3 id=p13019009_06-1>Ammonites and Syrians Defeated</h3><p id=p13019009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians. <b class=verse-num id=v13019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v13019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. <b class=verse-num id=v13019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab&#8217;s brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p13019015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. <b class=verse-num id=v13019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army. <b class=verse-num id=v13019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to save the Ammonites anymore.</p></div>

But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab struck down Rabbah and overthrew it. <b class=verse-num id=v13020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David took the crown of their king from his head. He found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was placed on David&#8217;s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. <b class=verse-num id=v13020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p><h3 id=p13020003_05-1>Philistine Giants Killed</h3><p id=p13020003_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v13020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued. <b class=verse-num id=v13020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam. <b class=verse-num id=v13020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants. <b class=verse-num id=v13020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David&#8217;s brother, struck him down. <b class=verse-num id=v13020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</p></div>

<h3 id=p13021001_01-1>David&#8217;s Census Brings Pestilence</h3><p id=p13021001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v13021001-1>21:1&nbsp;</b>Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v13021002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, &#8220;Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But Joab said, &#8220;May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord&#8217;s servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But the king&#8217;s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v13021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v13021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king&#8217;s command was abhorrent to Joab.</p><p id=p13021006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v13021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v13021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And David said to God, &#8220;I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD spoke to Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v13021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Go and say to David, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So Gad came to David and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Choose what you will: <b class=verse-num id=v13021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.&#8217; Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.&#8221;</p><p id=p13021013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v13021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell. <b class=verse-num id=v13021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, &#8220;It is enough; now stay your hand.&#8221; And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <b class=verse-num id=v13021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. <b class=verse-num id=v13021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And David said to God, &#8220;Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father&#8217;s house. But do not let the plague be on your people.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p13021017_05-1>David Builds an Altar</h3><p id=p13021017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v13021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the angel of the LORD had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <b class=verse-num id=v13021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So David went up at Gad&#8217;s word, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v13021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v13021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v13021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David said to Ornan, &#8220;Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD&#8212;give it to me at its full price&#8212;that the plague may be averted from the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Ornan said to David, &#8220;Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But King David said to Ornan, &#8220;No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site. <b class=verse-num id=v13021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering. <b class=verse-num id=v13021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</p><p id=p13021027_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v13021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. <b class=verse-num id=v13021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon, <b class=verse-num id=v13021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p></div>

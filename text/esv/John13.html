<h3 id=p43012001_01-1>Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany</h3><p id=p43012001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v43012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table. <b class=verse-num id=v43012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <b class=verse-num id=v43012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, <b class=verse-num id=v43012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. <b class=verse-num id=v43012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43012008_06-1>The Plot to Kill Lazarus</h3><p id=p43012008_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v43012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v43012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, <b class=verse-num id=v43012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</p><h3 id=p43012011_11-1>The Triumphal Entry</h3><p id=p43012011_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v43012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v43012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, &#8220;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p43012015_14-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v43012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Fear not, daughter of Zion;</span><br /><span id=p43012015_14-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, your king is coming,</span><br /><span id=p43012015_14-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting on a donkey&#8217;s colt!&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p43012015_14-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v43012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. <b class=verse-num id=v43012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. <b class=verse-num id=v43012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So the Pharisees said to one another, &#8220;You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43012019_14-1>Some Greeks Seek Jesus</h3><p id=p43012019_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v43012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. <b class=verse-num id=v43012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, &#8220;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v43012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012024-1>24&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012026-1>26&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span></p><h3 id=p43012026_18-1>The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up</h3><p id=p43012026_26-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v43012027-1>27&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? &#8216;Father, save me from this hour&#8217;? But for this purpose I have come to this hour.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012028-1>28&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Father, glorify your name.&#8221;</span> Then a voice came from heaven: &#8220;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, &#8220;An angel has spoken to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;This voice has come for your sake, not mine.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43012033-1>33&nbsp;</b>He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. <b class=verse-num id=v43012034-1>34&nbsp;</b>So the crowd answered him, &#8220;We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43012035-1>35&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43012036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p43012036_26-1>The Unbelief of the People</h3><p id=p43012036_31-1>When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them. <b class=verse-num id=v43012037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, <b class=verse-num id=v43012038-1>38&nbsp;</b>so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p43012038_31-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Lord, who has believed what he heard from us,</span><br /><span id=p43012038_31-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p43012038_31-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v43012039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Therefore they could not believe.

He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. <b class=verse-num id=v43013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <b class=verse-num id=v43013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &#8220;Lord, do you wash my feet?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Peter said to him, &#8220;You shall never wash my feet.&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Not all of you are clean.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p43013011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v43013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you understand what I have done to you?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43013018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen.

Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;What you are going to do, do quickly.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. <b class=verse-num id=v43013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#8220;Buy what we need for the feast,&#8221; or that he should give something to the poor. <b class=verse-num id=v43013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out.

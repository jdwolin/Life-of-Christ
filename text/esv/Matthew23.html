Come to the wedding feast.&#8221;&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then he said to his servants, &#8216;The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span></p><p id=p40022010_07-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40022011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said to him, &#8216;Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?&#8217; And he was speechless.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Then the king said to the attendants, &#8216;Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For many are called, but few are chosen.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40022014_07-1>Paying Taxes to Caesar</h3><p id=p40022014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v40022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. <b class=verse-num id=v40022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, &#8220;Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone&#8217;s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. <b class=verse-num id=v40022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why put me to the test, you hypocrites?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Show me the coin for the tax.&#8221;</span> And they brought him a denarius. <b class=verse-num id=v40022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>They said, &#8220;Caesar&#8217;s.&#8221; Then he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.</p><h3 id=p40022022_11-1>Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection</h3><p id=p40022022_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v40022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, <b class=verse-num id=v40022024-1>24&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Teacher, Moses said, &#8216;If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v40022025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v40022026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So too the second and third, down to the seventh. <b class=verse-num id=v40022027-1>27&nbsp;</b>After them all, the woman died. <b class=verse-num id=v40022028-1>28&nbsp;</b>In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.&#8221;</p><p id=p40022028_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v40022029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022031-1>31&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8216;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#8217;? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40022033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</p><h3 id=p40022033_16-1>The Great Commandment</h3><p id=p40022033_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v40022034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. <b class=verse-num id=v40022035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. <b class=verse-num id=v40022036-1>36&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40022037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>This is the great and first commandment.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022039-1>39&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40022040-1>40&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40022040_19-1>Whose Son Is the Christ?</h3><p id=p40022040_24-1><b class=verse-num id=v40022041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, <b class=verse-num id=v40022042-1>42&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;The son of David.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40022043-1>43&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</span></p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p40022044_24-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline woc id=v40022044-1>44&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=woc>&#8220;&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</span><br /><span id=p40022044_24-1 class=line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sit at my right hand,</span><br /><span id=p40022044_24-1 class=indent line><span class=woc>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I put your enemies under your feet&#8221;&#8217;?</span><br /></span><span class=end-line-group></span></span></span></p><p id=p40022044_24-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num woc id=v40022045-1>45&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40022046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.</p></div>

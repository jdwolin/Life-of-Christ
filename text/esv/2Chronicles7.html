So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. <b class=verse-num id=v14007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD&#8212;for his steadfast love endures forever&#8212;whenever David offered praises by their ministry; opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood.</p><p id=p14007006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat.</p><p id=p14007007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v14007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days. <b class=verse-num id=v14007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity that the LORD had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.</p><h3 id=p14007010_09-1>If My People Pray</h3><p id=p14007010_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king&#8217;s house.

My eyes and my heart will be there for all time. <b class=verse-num id=v14007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules, <b class=verse-num id=v14007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, &#8216;You shall not lack a man to rule Israel.&#8217;</p><p id=p14007018_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, <b class=verse-num id=v14007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>then I will pluck you up from my land that I have given you, and this house that I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <b class=verse-num id=v14007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, &#8216;Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v14007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then they will say, &#8216;Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

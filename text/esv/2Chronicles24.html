<h3 id=p14023001_01-1>Joash Made King</h3><p id=p14023001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14023001-1>23:1&nbsp;</b>But in the seventh year Jehoiada took courage and entered into a covenant with the commanders of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. <b class=verse-num id=v14023002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And they went about through Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers&#8217; houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14023003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, &#8220;Behold, the king&#8217;s son! Let him reign, as the LORD spoke concerning the sons of David. <b class=verse-num id=v14023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>This is the thing that you shall do: of you priests and Levites who come off duty on the Sabbath, one third shall be gatekeepers, <b class=verse-num id=v14023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and one third shall be at the king&#8217;s house and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and ministering Levites. They may enter, for they are holy, but all the people shall keep the charge of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever enters the house shall be put to death. Be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.&#8221;</p><p id=p14023007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men, who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions. <b class=verse-num id=v14023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David&#8217;s, which were in the house of God. <b class=verse-num id=v14023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he set all the people as a guard for the king, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house. <b class=verse-num id=v14023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then they brought out the king&#8217;s son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, &#8220;Long live the king.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14023011_04-1>Athaliah Executed</h3><p id=p14023011_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went into the house of the LORD to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v14023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and the singers with their musical instruments leading in the celebration. And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, &#8220;Treason! Treason!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, &#8220;Bring her out between the ranks, and anyone who follows her is to be put to death with the sword.&#8221; For the priest said, &#8220;Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So they laid hands on her, and she went into the entrance of the horse gate of the king&#8217;s house, and they put her to death there.</p><h3 id=p14023015_06-1>Jehoiada&#8217;s Reforms</h3><p id=p14023015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v14023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the LORD&#8217;s people. <b class=verse-num id=v14023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. <b class=verse-num id=v14023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Jehoiada posted watchmen for the house of the LORD under the direction of the Levitical priests and the Levites whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David. <b class=verse-num id=v14023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean. <b class=verse-num id=v14023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through the upper gate to the king&#8217;s house. And they set the king on the royal throne. <b class=verse-num id=v14023021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14024001_01-1>Joash Repairs the Temple</h3><p id=p14024001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. <b class=verse-num id=v14024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. <b class=verse-num id=v14024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Jehoiada got for him two wives, and he had sons and daughters.</p><p id=p14024003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>After this Joash decided to restore the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, &#8220;Go out to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you act quickly.&#8221; But the Levites did not act quickly. <b class=verse-num id=v14024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and said to him, &#8220;Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the congregation of Israel for the tent of testimony?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also used all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.</p><p id=p14024007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v14024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished. <b class=verse-num id=v14024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And whenever the chest was brought to the king&#8217;s officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was much money in it, the king&#8217;s secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place. Thus they did day after day, and collected money in abundance. <b class=verse-num id=v14024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the LORD, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went forward in their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it. <b class=verse-num id=v14024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made utensils for the house of the LORD, both for the service and for the burnt offerings, and dishes for incense and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD regularly all the days of Jehoiada.</p><p id=p14024014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and died. He was 130 years old at his death. <b class=verse-num id=v14024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.</p><p id=p14024016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them. <b class=verse-num id=v14024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs. <b class=verse-num id=v14024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the LORD. These testified against them, but they would not pay attention.</p><h3 id=p14024019_05-1>Joash&#8217;s Treachery</h3><p id=p14024019_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says God, &#8216;Why do you break the commandments of the LORD, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah&#8217;s father, had shown him, but killed his son. And when he was dying, he said, &#8220;May the LORD see and avenge!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14024022_07-1>Joash Assassinated</h3><p id=p14024022_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024023-1>23&nbsp;</b>At the end of the year the army of the Syrians came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v14024024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Though the army of the Syrians had come with few men, the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army, because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joash.</p><p id=p14024024_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14024025-1>25&nbsp;</b>When they had departed from him, leaving him severely wounded, his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings. <b class=verse-num id=v14024026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonite, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabite. <b class=verse-num id=v14024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Accounts of his sons and of the many oracles against him and of the rebuilding of the house of God are written in the Story of the Book of the Kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14025001_01-1>Amaziah Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14025001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14025001-1>25:1&nbsp;</b>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14025002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart. <b class=verse-num id=v14025003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And as soon as the royal power was firmly his, he killed his servants who had struck down the king his father. <b class=verse-num id=v14025004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, &#8220;Fathers shall not die because of their children, nor children die because of their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14025004_05-1>Amaziah&#8217;s Victories</h3><p id=p14025004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers&#8217; houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that they were 300,000 choice men, fit for war, able to handle spear and shield. <b class=verse-num id=v14025006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He hired also 100,000 mighty men of valor from Israel for 100 talents of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v14025007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But a man of God came to him and said, &#8220;O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these Ephraimites. <b class=verse-num id=v14025008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But go, act, be strong for the battle. Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy? For God has power to help or to cast down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Amaziah said to the man of God, &#8220;But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?&#8221; The man of God answered, &#8220;The LORD is able to give you much more than this.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger. <b class=verse-num id=v14025011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 men of Seir. <b class=verse-num id=v14025012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The men of Judah captured another 10,000 alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock, and they were all dashed to pieces. <b class=verse-num id=v14025013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 people in them and took much spoil.</p><h3 id=p14025013_07-1>Amaziah&#8217;s Idolatry</h3><p id=p14025013_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025014-1>14&nbsp;</b>After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them, making offerings to them. <b class=verse-num id=v14025015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, &#8220;Why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But as he was speaking, the king said to him, &#8220;Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?&#8221; So the prophet stopped, but said, &#8220;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14025016_09-1>Israel Defeats Amaziah</h3><p id=p14025016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Come, let us look one another in the face.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14025018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, &#8220;A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son for a wife,&#8217; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. <b class=verse-num id=v14025019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You say, &#8216;See, I have struck down Edom,&#8217; and your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?&#8221;</p><p id=p14025019_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought the gods of Edom. <b class=verse-num id=v14025021-1>21&nbsp;</b>So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14025022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home. <b class=verse-num id=v14025023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for 400 cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. <b class=verse-num id=v14025024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, in the care of Obed-edom. He seized also the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria.</p><p id=p14025024_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v14025025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14025026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? <b class=verse-num id=v14025027-1>27&nbsp;</b>From the time when he turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there. <b class=verse-num id=v14025028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they brought him upon horses, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David.</p></div>

<h3 id=p01022001_01-1>The Sacrifice of Isaac</h3><p id=p01022001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01022001-1>22:1&nbsp;</b>After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, &#8220;Abraham!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022002-1>2&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. <b class=verse-num id=v01022004-1>4&nbsp;</b>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. <b class=verse-num id=v01022005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham said to his young men, &#8220;Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. <b class=verse-num id=v01022007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Isaac said to his father Abraham, &#8220;My father!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am, my son.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Abraham said, &#8220;God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&#8221; So they went both of them together.</p><p id=p01022008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01022009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. <b class=verse-num id=v01022010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01022011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, &#8220;Abraham, Abraham!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. <b class=verse-num id=v01022014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Abraham called the name of that place, &#8220;The LORD will provide&#8221;; as it is said to this day, &#8220;On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.&#8221;</p><p id=p01022014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01022015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven <b class=verse-num id=v01022016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, <b class=verse-num id=v01022017-1>17&nbsp;</b>I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, <b class=verse-num id=v01022018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.</p><p id=p01022019_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01022020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now after these things it was told to Abraham, &#8220;Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: <b class=verse-num id=v01022021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, <b class=verse-num id=v01022022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01022023-1>23&nbsp;</b>(Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham&#8217;s brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01022024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</p></div>

Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar, <b class=verse-num id=v01023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.&#8221;</p><p id=p01023009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city, <b class=verse-num id=v01023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, &#8220;But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Ephron answered Abraham, <b class=verse-num id=v01023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.</p><p id=p01023016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over <b class=verse-num id=v01023018-1>18&nbsp;</b>to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city. <b class=verse-num id=v01023019-1>19&nbsp;</b>After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. <b class=verse-num id=v01023020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.</p></div>

And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. <b class=verse-num id=v01024031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01024032-1>32&nbsp;</b>So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01024033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then food was set before him to eat.

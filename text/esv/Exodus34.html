<h3 id=p02033001_01-1>The Command to Leave Sinai</h3><p id=p02033001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v02033001-1>33:1&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Depart; go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, &#8216;To your offspring I will give it.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02033002-1>2&nbsp;</b>I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <b class=verse-num id=v02033003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.&#8221;</p><p id=p02033003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v02033004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When the people heard this disastrous word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments. <b class=verse-num id=v02033005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For the LORD had said to Moses, &#8220;Say to the people of Israel, &#8216;You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02033006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.</p><h3 id=p02033006_06-1>The Tent of Meeting</h3><p id=p02033006_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v02033007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp. <b class=verse-num id=v02033008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up, and each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent. <b class=verse-num id=v02033009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v02033010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door. <b class=verse-num id=v02033011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.</p><h3 id=p02033011_10-1>Moses&#8217; Intercession</h3><p id=p02033011_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v02033012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Moses said to the LORD, &#8220;See, you say to me, &#8216;Bring up this people,&#8217; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, &#8216;I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v02033013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02033014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02033015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here. <b class=verse-num id=v02033016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?&#8221;</p><p id=p02033016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v02033017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02033018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;Please show me your glory.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02033019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name &#8216;The LORD.&#8217; And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. <b class=verse-num id=v02033020-1>20&nbsp;</b>But,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02033021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said, &#8220;Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, <b class=verse-num id=v02033022-1>22&nbsp;</b>and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. <b class=verse-num id=v02033023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.&#8221;</p></div>

Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02034004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone. <b class=verse-num id=v02034005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02034006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, &#8220;The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, <b class=verse-num id=v02034007-1>7&nbsp;</b>keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children&#8217;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02034008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped. <b class=verse-num id=v02034009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p02034009_05-1>The Covenant Renewed</h3><p id=p02034009_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v02034010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Behold, I am making a covenant.

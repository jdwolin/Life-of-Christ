<h3 id=p44019001_01-1>Paul in Ephesus</h3><p id=p44019001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v44019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. <b class=verse-num id=v44019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Into what then were you baptized?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Into John&#8217;s baptism.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Paul said, &#8220;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. <b class=verse-num id=v44019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>There were about twelve men in all.</p><p id=p44019007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. <b class=verse-num id=v44019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</p><h3 id=p44019010_04-1>The Sons of Sceva</h3><p id=p44019010_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, <b class=verse-num id=v44019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. <b class=verse-num id=v44019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, &#8220;I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. <b class=verse-num id=v44019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the evil spirit answered them, &#8220;Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <b class=verse-num id=v44019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. <b class=verse-num id=v44019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. <b class=verse-num id=v44019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v44019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.</p><h3 id=p44019020_08-1>A Riot at Ephesus</h3><p id=p44019020_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</p><p id=p44019022_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019023-1>23&nbsp;</b>About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way. <b class=verse-num id=v44019024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. <b class=verse-num id=v44019025-1>25&nbsp;</b>These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, &#8220;Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. <b class=verse-num id=v44019026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. <b class=verse-num id=v44019027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.&#8221;</p><p id=p44019027_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019028-1>28&nbsp;</b>When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, &#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul&#8217;s companions in travel. <b class=verse-num id=v44019030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him. <b class=verse-num id=v44019031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater. <b class=verse-num id=v44019032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. <b class=verse-num id=v44019033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v44019034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, &#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221;</p><p id=p44019034_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v44019035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, &#8220;Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? <b class=verse-num id=v44019036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. <b class=verse-num id=v44019037-1>37&nbsp;</b>For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. <b class=verse-num id=v44019038-1>38&nbsp;</b>If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. <b class=verse-num id=v44019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v44019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p></div>

And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. <b class=verse-num id=v44020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, &#8220;Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. <b class=verse-num id=v44020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.</p><p id=p44020012_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v44020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land. <b class=verse-num id=v44020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. <b class=verse-num id=v44020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus. <b class=verse-num id=v44020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</p><h3 id=p44020016_11-1>Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders</h3><p id=p44020016_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. <b class=verse-num id=v44020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when they came to him, he said to them:</p><p id=p44020018_17-1>&#8220;You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, <b class=verse-num id=v44020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; <b class=verse-num id=v44020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, <b class=verse-num id=v44020021-1>21&nbsp;</b>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v44020022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, <b class=verse-num id=v44020023-1>23&nbsp;</b>except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. <b class=verse-num id=v44020024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44020025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. <b class=verse-num id=v44020026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, <b class=verse-num id=v44020027-1>27&nbsp;</b>for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44020028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. <b class=verse-num id=v44020029-1>29&nbsp;</b>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; <b class=verse-num id=v44020030-1>30&nbsp;</b>and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. <b class=verse-num id=v44020031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. <b class=verse-num id=v44020032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. <b class=verse-num id=v44020033-1>33&nbsp;</b>I coveted no one&#8217;s silver or gold or apparel. <b class=verse-num id=v44020034-1>34&nbsp;</b>You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. <b class=verse-num id=v44020035-1>35&nbsp;</b>In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, <span class=woc>&#8216;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8217;</span>&#8221;</p><p id=p44020035_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v44020036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. <b class=verse-num id=v44020037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him, <b class=verse-num id=v44020038-1>38&nbsp;</b>being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again.

And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44021005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed <b class=verse-num id=v44021006-1>6&nbsp;</b>and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</p><p id=p44021006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021007-1>7&nbsp;</b>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day. <b class=verse-num id=v44021008-1>8&nbsp;</b>On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. <b class=verse-num id=v44021009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. <b class=verse-num id=v44021010-1>10&nbsp;</b>While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <b class=verse-num id=v44021011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And coming to us, he took Paul&#8217;s belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, &#8220;Thus says the Holy Spirit, &#8216;This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44021013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then Paul answered, &#8220;What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, &#8220;Let the will of the Lord be done.&#8221;</p><p id=p44021014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021015-1>15&nbsp;</b>After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v44021016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</p><h3 id=p44021016_05-1>Paul Visits James</h3><p id=p44021016_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021017-1>17&nbsp;</b>When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. <b class=verse-num id=v44021018-1>18&nbsp;</b>On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. <b class=verse-num id=v44021019-1>19&nbsp;</b>After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. <b class=verse-num id=v44021020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, &#8220;You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law, <b class=verse-num id=v44021021-1>21&nbsp;</b>and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs. <b class=verse-num id=v44021022-1>22&nbsp;</b>What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. <b class=verse-num id=v44021023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; <b class=verse-num id=v44021024-1>24&nbsp;</b>take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law. <b class=verse-num id=v44021025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.</p><h3 id=p44021026_08-1>Paul Arrested in the Temple</h3><p id=p44021026_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021027-1>27&nbsp;</b>When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, <b class=verse-num id=v44021028-1>28&nbsp;</b>crying out, &#8220;Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. <b class=verse-num id=v44021030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. <b class=verse-num id=v44021031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. <b class=verse-num id=v44021032-1>32&nbsp;</b>He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. <b class=verse-num id=v44021033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. <b class=verse-num id=v44021034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. <b class=verse-num id=v44021035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, <b class=verse-num id=v44021036-1>36&nbsp;</b>for the mob of the people followed, crying out, &#8220;Away with him!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p44021036_13-1>Paul Speaks to the People</h3><p id=p44021036_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44021037-1>37&nbsp;</b>As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, &#8220;May I say something to you?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Do you know Greek? <b class=verse-num id=v44021038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021039-1>39&nbsp;</b>Paul replied, &#8220;I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44021040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:</p></div>

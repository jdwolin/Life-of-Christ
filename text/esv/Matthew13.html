<h3 id=p40014001_01-1>The Death of John the Baptist</h3><p id=p40014001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v40014001-1>14:1&nbsp;</b>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v40014002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and he said to his servants, &#8220;This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, <b class=verse-num id=v40014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>because John had been saying to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v40014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But when Herod&#8217;s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, <b class=verse-num id=v40014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. <b class=verse-num id=v40014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Prompted by her mother, she said, &#8220;Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. <b class=verse-num id=v40014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, <b class=verse-num id=v40014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. <b class=verse-num id=v40014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.</p><h3 id=p40014012_07-1>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h3><p id=p40014012_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v40014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. <b class=verse-num id=v40014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. <b class=verse-num id=v40014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, &#8220;This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;They need not go away; you give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;We have only five loaves here and two fish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Bring them here to me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v40014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. <b class=verse-num id=v40014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p><h3 id=p40014021_12-1>Jesus Walks on the Water</h3><p id=p40014021_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v40014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v40014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, <b class=verse-num id=v40014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. <b class=verse-num id=v40014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. <b class=verse-num id=v40014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, &#8220;It is a ghost!&#8221; and they cried out in fear. <b class=verse-num id=v40014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p40014027_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v40014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Peter answered him, &#8220;Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>He said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</span> So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v40014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, &#8220;Lord, save me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40014032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. <b class=verse-num id=v40014033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, &#8220;Truly you are the Son of God.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40014033_17-1>Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret</h3><p id=p40014033_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v40014034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. <b class=verse-num id=v40014035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick <b class=verse-num id=v40014036-1>36&nbsp;</b>and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.</p></div>

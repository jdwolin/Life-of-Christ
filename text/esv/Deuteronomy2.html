<h3 id=p05001001_01-1>The Command to Leave Horeb</h3><p id=p05001001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <b class=verse-num id=v05001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>It is eleven days&#8217; journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. <b class=verse-num id=v05001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them, <b class=verse-num id=v05001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. <b class=verse-num id=v05001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v05001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;The LORD our God said to us in Horeb, &#8216;You have stayed long enough at this mountain. <b class=verse-num id=v05001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. <b class=verse-num id=v05001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p05001008_06-1>Leaders Appointed</h3><p id=p05001008_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;At that time I said to you, &#8216;I am not able to bear you by myself. <b class=verse-num id=v05001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v05001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>May the LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you! <b class=verse-num id=v05001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife? <b class=verse-num id=v05001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And you answered me, &#8216;The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes. <b class=verse-num id=v05001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I charged your judges at that time, &#8216;Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him. <b class=verse-num id=v05001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God&#8217;s. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.</p><h3 id=p05001018_08-1>Israel&#8217;s Refusal to Enter the Land</h3><p id=p05001018_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v05001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then we set out from Horeb and went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us. And we came to Kadesh-barnea. <b class=verse-num id=v05001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And I said to you, &#8216;You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us. <b class=verse-num id=v05001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>See, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not fear or be dismayed.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then all of you came near me and said, &#8216;Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe. <b class=verse-num id=v05001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out. <b class=verse-num id=v05001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, &#8216;It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.&#8217;</p><p id=p05001025_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v05001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. <b class=verse-num id=v05001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And you murmured in your tents and said, &#8216;Because the LORD hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. <b class=verse-num id=v05001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, &#8220;The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Then I said to you, &#8216;Do not be in dread or afraid of them. <b class=verse-num id=v05001030-1>30&nbsp;</b>The LORD your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, <b class=verse-num id=v05001031-1>31&nbsp;</b>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the LORD your God, <b class=verse-num id=v05001033-1>33&nbsp;</b>who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.</p><h3 id=p05001033_14-1>The Penalty for Israel&#8217;s Rebellion</h3><p id=p05001033_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v05001034-1>34&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And the LORD heard your words and was angered, and he swore, <b class=verse-num id=v05001035-1>35&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers, <b class=verse-num id=v05001036-1>36&nbsp;</b>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the LORD!&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Even with me the LORD was angry on your account and said, &#8216;You also shall not go in there. <b class=verse-num id=v05001038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <b class=verse-num id=v05001039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it. <b class=verse-num id=v05001040-1>40&nbsp;</b>But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.&#8217;</p><p id=p05001040_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v05001041-1>41&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then you answered me, &#8216;We have sinned against the LORD. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.&#8217; And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country. <b class=verse-num id=v05001042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05001043-1>43&nbsp;</b>So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country. <b class=verse-num id=v05001044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah. <b class=verse-num id=v05001045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And you returned and wept before the LORD, but the LORD did not listen to your voice or give ear to you. <b class=verse-num id=v05001046-1>46&nbsp;</b>So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.</p></div>

<h3 id=p05002001_01-1>The Wilderness Years</h3><p id=p05002001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir. <b class=verse-num id=v05002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to me, <b class=verse-num id=v05002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8216;You have been traveling around this mountain country long enough. Turn northward <b class=verse-num id=v05002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>and command the people, &#8220;You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful. <b class=verse-num id=v05002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. <b class=verse-num id=v05002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink. <b class=verse-num id=v05002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.</p><p id=p05002008_04-1>&#8220;And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab. <b class=verse-num id=v05002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim. <b class=verse-num id=v05002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim. <b class=verse-num id=v05002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.) <b class=verse-num id=v05002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.&#8217; So we went over the brook Zered. <b class=verse-num id=v05002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. <b class=verse-num id=v05002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.</p><p id=p05002015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people, <b class=verse-num id=v05002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>the LORD said to me, <b class=verse-num id=v05002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar. <b class=verse-num id=v05002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>(It is also counted as a land of Rephaim.

Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle. <b class=verse-num id=v05002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p05002025_04-1>The Defeat of King Sihon</h3><p id=p05002025_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v05002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v05002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&#8216;Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left. <b class=verse-num id=v05002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot, <b class=verse-num id=v05002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002030-1>30&nbsp;</b>But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day. <b class=verse-num id=v05002031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05002032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. <b class=verse-num id=v05002033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the LORD our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people. <b class=verse-num id=v05002034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors. <b class=verse-num id=v05002035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured. <b class=verse-num id=v05002036-1>36&nbsp;</b>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God gave all into our hands. <b class=verse-num id=v05002037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us.</p></div>

And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <b class=verse-num id=v05003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to me, &#8216;Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left. <b class=verse-num id=v05003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And we took all his cities at that time&#8212;there was not a city that we did not take from them&#8212;sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <b class=verse-num id=v05003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages. <b class=verse-num id=v05003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And we devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children. <b class=verse-num id=v05003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder. <b class=verse-num id=v05003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon <b class=verse-num id=v05003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir), <b class=verse-num id=v05003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <b class=verse-num id=v05003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim.

And the LORD said to me, &#8216;Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again. <b class=verse-num id=v05003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan. <b class=verse-num id=v05003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.</p></div>

You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God. <b class=verse-num id=v64001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. <b class=verse-num id=v64001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.</p><p id=p64001008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v64001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. <b class=verse-num id=v64001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.</p><p id=p64001010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v64001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God. <b class=verse-num id=v64001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.</p><h3 id=p64001012_05-1>Final Greetings</h3><p id=p64001012_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v64001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink. <b class=verse-num id=v64001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.</p><p id=p64001014_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v64001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Peace be to you.

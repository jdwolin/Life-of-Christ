<h3 id=p07012001_01-1>Jephthah&#8217;s Conflict with Ephraim</h3><p id=p07012001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v07012001-1>12:1&nbsp;</b>The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, &#8220;Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07012002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Jephthah said to them, &#8220;I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand. <b class=verse-num id=v07012003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And when I saw that you would not save me, I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, &#8220;You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, &#8220;Let me go over,&#8221; the men of Gilead said to him, &#8220;Are you an Ephraimite?&#8221; When he said, &#8220;No,&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>they said to him, &#8220;Then say Shibboleth,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Sibboleth,&#8221; for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell.</p><p id=p07012006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead.</p><h3 id=p07012007_05-1>Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon</h3><p id=p07012007_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v07012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v07012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. <b class=verse-num id=v07012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.</p><p id=p07012010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v07012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. <b class=verse-num id=v07012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.</p><p id=p07012012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v07012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v07012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years. <b class=verse-num id=v07012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.</p></div>

And his wife was barren and had no children. <b class=verse-num id=v07013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, &#8220;Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. <b class=verse-num id=v07013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, <b class=verse-num id=v07013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the woman came and told her husband, &#8220;A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name, <b class=verse-num id=v07013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>but he said to me, &#8216;Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p07013007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, &#8220;O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her. <b class=verse-num id=v07013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, &#8220;Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, &#8220;Are you the man who spoke to this woman?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Manoah said, &#8220;Now when your words come true, what is to be the child&#8217;s manner of life, and what is his mission?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, &#8220;Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful. <b class=verse-num id=v07013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.&#8221;</p><p id=p07013014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, &#8220;Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat for you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, &#8220;If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD.&#8221; (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.) <b class=verse-num id=v07013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, &#8220;What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD said to him, &#8220;Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD, to the one who works wonders, and Manoah and his wife were watching. <b class=verse-num id=v07013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the LORD went up in the flame of the altar. Now Manoah and his wife were watching, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</p><p id=p07013020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v07013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>The angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v07013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And Manoah said to his wife, &#8220;We shall surely die, for we have seen God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But his wife said to him, &#8220;If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v07013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the young man grew, and the LORD blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v07013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p></div>

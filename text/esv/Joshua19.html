<h3 id=p06018001_01-1>Allotment of the Remaining Land</h3><p id=p06018001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The land lay subdued before them.</p><p id=p06018001_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>There remained among the people of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not yet been apportioned. <b class=verse-num id=v06018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>So Joshua said to the people of Israel, &#8220;How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land, which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? <b class=verse-num id=v06018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Provide three men from each tribe, and I will send them out that they may set out and go up and down the land. They shall write a description of it with a view to their inheritances, and then come to me. <b class=verse-num id=v06018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall continue in his territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north. <b class=verse-num id=v06018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And you shall describe the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. <b class=verse-num id=v06018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their heritage. And Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.&#8221;</p><p id=p06018007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So the men arose and went, and Joshua charged those who went to write the description of the land, saying, &#8220;Go up and down in the land and write a description and return to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v06018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So the men went and passed up and down in the land and wrote in a book a description of it by towns in seven divisions. Then they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh, <b class=verse-num id=v06018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD. And there Joshua apportioned the land to the people of Israel, to each his portion.</p><h3 id=p06018010_06-1>The Inheritance for Benjamin</h3><p id=p06018010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The lot of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to its clans came up, and the territory allotted to it fell between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v06018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan. Then the boundary goes up to the shoulder north of Jericho, then up through the hill country westward, and it ends at the wilderness of Beth-aven. <b class=verse-num id=v06018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the shoulder of Luz (that is, Bethel), then the boundary goes down to Ataroth-addar, on the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon. <b class=verse-num id=v06018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary goes in another direction, turning on the western side southward from the mountain that lies to the south, opposite Beth-horon, and it ends at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city belonging to the people of Judah. This forms the western side. <b class=verse-num id=v06018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the southern side begins at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim. And the boundary goes from there to Ephron, to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. <b class=verse-num id=v06018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary goes down to the border of the mountain that overlooks the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim. And it then goes down the Valley of Hinnom, south of the shoulder of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel. <b class=verse-num id=v06018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then it bends in a northerly direction going on to En-shemesh, and from there goes to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim. Then it goes down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, <b class=verse-num id=v06018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and passing on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-arabah it goes down to the Arabah. <b class=verse-num id=v06018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the boundary passes on to the north of the shoulder of Beth-hoglah. And the boundary ends at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this is the southern border. <b class=verse-num id=v06018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The Jordan forms its boundary on the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the people of Benjamin, according to their clans, boundary by boundary all around.</p><p id=p06018020_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v06018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now the cities of the tribe of the people of Benjamin according to their clans were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, <b class=verse-num id=v06018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, <b class=verse-num id=v06018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, <b class=verse-num id=v06018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, Geba&#8212;twelve cities with their villages: <b class=verse-num id=v06018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, <b class=verse-num id=v06018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, <b class=verse-num id=v06018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, <b class=verse-num id=v06018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath-jearim&#8212;fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the people of Benjamin according to its clans.</p></div>

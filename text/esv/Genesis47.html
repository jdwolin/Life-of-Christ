They are now in the land of Goshen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v01047003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Pharaoh said to his brothers, &#8220;What is your occupation?&#8221; And they said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They said to Pharaoh, &#8220;We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants&#8217; flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Your father and your brothers have come to you. <b class=verse-num id=v01047006-1>6&nbsp;</b>The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land.

And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01047015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, &#8220;Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Joseph answered, &#8220;Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. <b class=verse-num id=v01047018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, &#8220;We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent.

The land became Pharaoh&#8217;s. <b class=verse-num id=v01047021-1>21&nbsp;</b>As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other. <b class=verse-num id=v01047022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.</p><p id=p01047022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to the people, &#8220;Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. <b class=verse-num id=v01047024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they said, &#8220;You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh&#8217;s.</p><p id=p01047026_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. <b class=verse-num id=v01047028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.</p><p id=p01047028_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v01047029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v01047030-1>30&nbsp;</b>but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I will do as you have said.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01047031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Swear to me&#8221;; and he swore to him.

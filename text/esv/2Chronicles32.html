Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession.</p><p id=p14031001_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14031002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of the LORD and to give thanks and praise. <b class=verse-num id=v14031003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, as it is written in the Law of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14031004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the Law of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14031005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. <b class=verse-num id=v14031006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of the dedicated things that had been dedicated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps. <b class=verse-num id=v14031007-1>7&nbsp;</b>In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. <b class=verse-num id=v14031008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14031009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps. <b class=verse-num id=v14031010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Azariah the chief priest, who was of the house of Zadok, answered him, &#8220;Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed his people, so that we have this large amount left.&#8221;</p><p id=p14031010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14031011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them. <b class=verse-num id=v14031012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the dedicated things. The chief officer in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shimei his brother as second, <b class=verse-num id=v14031013-1>13&nbsp;</b>while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God. <b class=verse-num id=v14031014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the LORD and the most holy offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v14031015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their brothers, old and young alike, by divisions, <b class=verse-num id=v14031016-1>16&nbsp;</b>except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upward&#8212;all who entered the house of the LORD as the duty of each day required&#8212;for their service according to their offices, by their divisions. <b class=verse-num id=v14031017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers&#8217; houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices, by their divisions. <b class=verse-num id=v14031018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole assembly, for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy. <b class=verse-num id=v14031019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities, there were men in the several cities who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone among the Levites who was enrolled.</p><p id=p14031019_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14031020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14031021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered.</p></div>

He also made weapons and shields in abundance. <b class=verse-num id=v14032006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he set combat commanders over the people and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14032007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him, for there are more with us than with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14032008-1>8&nbsp;</b>With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles.&#8221; And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p><h3 id=p14032008_04-1>Sennacherib Blasphemes</h3><p id=p14032008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032009-1>9&nbsp;</b>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14032010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, &#8216;On what are you trusting, that you endure the siege in Jerusalem? <b class=verse-num id=v14032011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, &#8220;The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v14032012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, &#8220;Before one altar you shall worship, and on it you shall burn your sacrifices&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v14032013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v14032014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers devoted to destruction was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v14032015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p14032015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And his servants said still more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah. <b class=verse-num id=v14032017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, &#8220;Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city. <b class=verse-num id=v14032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men&#8217;s hands.</p><h3 id=p14032019_06-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Delivers Jerusalem</h3><p id=p14032019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v14032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v14032022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies, and he provided for them on every side. <b class=verse-num id=v14032023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.</p><h3 id=p14032023_10-1>Hezekiah&#8217;s Pride and Achievements</h3><p id=p14032023_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032024-1>24&nbsp;</b>In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to the LORD, and he answered him and gave him a sign. <b class=verse-num id=v14032025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But Hezekiah did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p><p id=p14032026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels; <b class=verse-num id=v14032028-1>28&nbsp;</b>storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds. <b class=verse-num id=v14032029-1>29&nbsp;</b>He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions. <b class=verse-num id=v14032030-1>30&nbsp;</b>This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. <b class=verse-num id=v14032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart.</p><p id=p14032031_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14032033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v14033007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, &#8220;In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever, <b class=verse-num id=v14033008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land that I appointed for your fathers, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the rules given through Moses.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14033009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.</p><h3 id=p14033009_05-1>Manasseh&#8217;s Repentance</h3><p id=p14033009_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14033010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they paid no attention. <b class=verse-num id=v14033011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks and bound him with chains of bronze and brought him to Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v14033012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14033013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He prayed to him, and God was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.

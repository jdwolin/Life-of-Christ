<h3 id=p41015001_01-1>Jesus Delivered to Pilate</h3><p id=p41015001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v41015001-1>15:1&nbsp;</b>And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. <b class=verse-num id=v41015002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Pilate asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; And he answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41015003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the chief priests accused him of many things. <b class=verse-num id=v41015004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Pilate again asked him, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</p><h3 id=p41015005_05-1>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</h3><p id=p41015005_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. <b class=verse-num id=v41015007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. <b class=verse-num id=v41015008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. <b class=verse-num id=v41015009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he answered them, saying, &#8220;Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. <b class=verse-num id=v41015011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. <b class=verse-num id=v41015012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Pilate again said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And they cried out again, &#8220;Crucify him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Pilate said to them, &#8220;Why? What evil has he done?&#8221; But they shouted all the more, &#8220;Crucify him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p><h3 id=p41015015_11-1>Jesus Is Mocked</h3><p id=p41015015_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor&#8217;s headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. <b class=verse-num id=v41015017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <b class=verse-num id=v41015018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they began to salute him, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. <b class=verse-num id=v41015020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.</p><h3 id=p41015020_14-1>The Crucifixion</h3><p id=p41015020_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. <b class=verse-num id=v41015022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). <b class=verse-num id=v41015023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <b class=verse-num id=v41015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. <b class=verse-num id=v41015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And it was the third hour when they crucified him. <b class=verse-num id=v41015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the inscription of the charge against him read, &#8220;The King of the Jews.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. <b class=verse-num id=v41015029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, &#8220;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, <b class=verse-num id=v41015030-1>30&nbsp;</b>save yourself, and come down from the cross!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015031-1>31&nbsp;</b>So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, &#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself. <b class=verse-num id=v41015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.&#8221; Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</p><h3 id=p41015032_16-1>The Death of Jesus</h3><p id=p41015032_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. <b class=verse-num id=v41015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, <span class=woc>&#8220;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&#8221;</span> which means, <span class=woc>&#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And some of the bystanders hearing it said, &#8220;Behold, he is calling Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, &#8220;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. <b class=verse-num id=v41015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. <b class=verse-num id=v41015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, &#8220;Truly this man was the Son of God!&#8221;</p><p id=p41015039_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015040-1>40&nbsp;</b>There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. <b class=verse-num id=v41015041-1>41&nbsp;</b>When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</p><h3 id=p41015041_20-1>Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id=p41015041_23-1><b class=verse-num id=v41015042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, <b class=verse-num id=v41015043-1>43&nbsp;</b>Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v41015044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. <b class=verse-num id=v41015045-1>45&nbsp;</b>And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v41015046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. <b class=verse-num id=v41015047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</p></div>

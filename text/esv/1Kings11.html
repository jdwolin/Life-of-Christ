<h3 id=p11010001_01-1>The Queen of Sheba</h3><p id=p11010001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11010001-1>10:1&nbsp;</b>Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions. <b class=verse-num id=v11010002-1>2&nbsp;</b>She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind. <b class=verse-num id=v11010003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her. <b class=verse-num id=v11010004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, <b class=verse-num id=v11010005-1>5&nbsp;</b>the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.</p><p id=p11010005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11010006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And she said to the king, &#8220;The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom, <b class=verse-num id=v11010007-1>7&nbsp;</b>but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard. <b class=verse-num id=v11010008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! <b class=verse-num id=v11010009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11010010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</p><p id=p11010010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11010011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones. <b class=verse-num id=v11010012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king&#8217;s house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.</p><p id=p11010012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v11010013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.</p><h3 id=p11010013_05-1>Solomon&#8217;s Great Wealth</h3><p id=p11010013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11010014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, <b class=verse-num id=v11010015-1>15&nbsp;</b>besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v11010016-1>16&nbsp;</b>King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield. <b class=verse-num id=v11010017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. <b class=verse-num id=v11010018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold. <b class=verse-num id=v11010019-1>19&nbsp;</b>The throne had six steps, and the throne had a round top, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests, <b class=verse-num id=v11010020-1>20&nbsp;</b>while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom. <b class=verse-num id=v11010021-1>21&nbsp;</b>All King Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. <b class=verse-num id=v11010022-1>22&nbsp;</b>For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</p><p id=p11010022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11010023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. <b class=verse-num id=v11010024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. <b class=verse-num id=v11010025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.</p><p id=p11010025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v11010026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11010027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. <b class=verse-num id=v11010028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Solomon&#8217;s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king&#8217;s traders received them from Kue at a price. <b class=verse-num id=v11010029-1>29&nbsp;</b>A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150, and so through the king&#8217;s traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</p></div>

<h3 id=p11011001_01-1>Solomon Turns from the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span></h3><p id=p11011001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v11011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, <b class=verse-num id=v11011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, &#8220;You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.&#8221; Solomon clung to these in love. <b class=verse-num id=v11011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. <b class=verse-num id=v11011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. <b class=verse-num id=v11011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v11011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done. <b class=verse-num id=v11011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v11011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.</p><h3 id=p11011008_06-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Raises Adversaries</h3><p id=p11011008_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice <b class=verse-num id=v11011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the LORD commanded. <b class=verse-num id=v11011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, &#8220;Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v11011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. <b class=verse-num id=v11011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen.&#8221;</p><p id=p11011013_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal house in Edom. <b class=verse-num id=v11011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom <b class=verse-num id=v11011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom). <b class=verse-num id=v11011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father&#8217;s servants, Hadad still being a little child. <b class=verse-num id=v11011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land. <b class=verse-num id=v11011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. <b class=verse-num id=v11011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh&#8217;s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh&#8217;s house among the sons of Pharaoh. <b class=verse-num id=v11011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But Pharaoh said to him, &#8220;What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Only let me depart.&#8221;</p><p id=p11011022_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah. <b class=verse-num id=v11011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus. <b class=verse-num id=v11011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria.</p><p id=p11011025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother&#8217;s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. <b class=verse-num id=v11011027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father. <b class=verse-num id=v11011028-1>28&nbsp;</b>The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. <b class=verse-num id=v11011029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country. <b class=verse-num id=v11011030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. <b class=verse-num id=v11011031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he said to Jeroboam, &#8220;Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes <b class=verse-num id=v11011032-1>32&nbsp;</b>(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), <b class=verse-num id=v11011033-1>33&nbsp;</b>because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did. <b class=verse-num id=v11011034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes. <b class=verse-num id=v11011035-1>35&nbsp;</b>But I will take the kingdom out of his son&#8217;s hand and will give it to you, ten tribes. <b class=verse-num id=v11011036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name. <b class=verse-num id=v11011037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v11011038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. <b class=verse-num id=v11011039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11011040-1>40&nbsp;</b>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p><p id=p11011040_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11011041-1>41&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? <b class=verse-num id=v11011042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v11011043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, &#8220;Go away for three days, then come again to me.&#8221; So the people went away.</p><p id=p11012005_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v11012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, &#8220;How do you advise me to answer this people?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. <b class=verse-num id=v11012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, &#8220;What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, &#8216;Lighten the yoke that your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, &#8220;Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, &#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,&#8217; thus shall you say to them, &#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s thighs. <b class=verse-num id=v11012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke.

We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.&#8221; So Israel went to their tents. <b class=verse-num id=v11012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v11012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones.

So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. <b class=verse-num id=v11012033-1>33&nbsp;</b>He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart.

<h3 id=p24034001_01-1>Zedekiah to Die in Babylon</h3><p id=p24034001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v24034001-1>34:1&nbsp;</b>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities: <b class=verse-num id=v24034002-1>2&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. <b class=verse-num id=v24034003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v24034004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: &#8216;You shall not die by the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v24034005-1>5&nbsp;</b>You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, &#8220;Alas, lord!&#8221;&#8217; For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p24034005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24034006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v24034007-1>7&nbsp;</b>when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.</p><p id=p24034007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24034008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them, <b class=verse-num id=v24034009-1>9&nbsp;</b>that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v24034010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free. <b class=verse-num id=v24034011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves. <b class=verse-num id=v24034012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <b class=verse-num id=v24034013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v24034014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8216;At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.&#8217; But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me. <b class=verse-num id=v24034015-1>15&nbsp;</b>You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name, <b class=verse-num id=v24034016-1>16&nbsp;</b>but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.</p><p id=p24034016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v24034017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v24034018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v24034019-1>19&nbsp;</b>the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf. <b class=verse-num id=v24034020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v24034021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you. <b class=verse-num id=v24034022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will command, declares the LORD, and will bring them back to this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.&#8221;</p></div>

You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities. <b class=verse-num id=v24036007-1>7&nbsp;</b>It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p24036008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036009-1>9&nbsp;</b>In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v24036010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p24036010_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, <b class=verse-num id=v24036012-1>12&nbsp;</b>he went down to the king&#8217;s house, into the secretary&#8217;s chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials. <b class=verse-num id=v24036013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v24036014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, &#8220;Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.&#8221; So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, &#8220;Sit down and read it.&#8221; So Baruch read it to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036016-1>16&nbsp;</b>When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, &#8220;We must report all these words to the king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then they asked Baruch, &#8220;Tell us, please, how did you write all these words?

And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king. <b class=verse-num id=v24036022-1>22&nbsp;</b>It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him. <b class=verse-num id=v24036023-1>23&nbsp;</b>As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot. <b class=verse-num id=v24036024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments. <b class=verse-num id=v24036025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. <b class=verse-num id=v24036026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king&#8217;s son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.</p><p id=p24036026_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <b class=verse-num id=v24036028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. <b class=verse-num id=v24036029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, &#8220;Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v24036030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night. <b class=verse-num id=v24036031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p24036031_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v24036032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire.

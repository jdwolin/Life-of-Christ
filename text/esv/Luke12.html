Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.</span></p><p id=p42011041_28-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v42011042-1>42&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011043-1>43&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011044-1>44&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p42011044_28-1><b class=verse-num id=v42011045-1>45&nbsp;</b>One of the lawyers answered him, &#8220;Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42011046-1>46&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011047-1>47&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011048-1>48&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011049-1>49&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, &#8216;I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011050-1>50&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42011051-1>51&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.

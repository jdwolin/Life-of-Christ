Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him? <b class=verse-num id=v14002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. <b class=verse-num id=v14002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants, <b class=verse-num id=v14002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful. <b class=verse-num id=v14002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>I will give for your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, 20,000 cors of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.&#8221;</p><p id=p14002010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, &#8220;Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Hiram also said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, who has discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.</p><p id=p14002012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now I have sent a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi, <b class=verse-num id=v14002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father. <b class=verse-num id=v14002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants. <b class=verse-num id=v14002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.&#8221;</p><p id=p14002016_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600. <b class=verse-num id=v14002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work.</p></div>

He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold. <b class=verse-num id=v14003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold and made palms and chains on it. <b class=verse-num id=v14003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim. <b class=verse-num id=v14003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So he lined the house with gold&#8212;its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors&#8212;and he carved cherubim on the walls.</p><p id=p14003007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he made the Most Holy Place.

The cherubim stood on their feet, facing the nave. <b class=verse-num id=v14003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.</p><p id=p14003014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each. <b class=verse-num id=v14003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains. <b class=verse-num id=v14003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz.</p></div>

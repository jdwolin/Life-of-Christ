It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v15005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus: &#8216;Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v15005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of their leaders. <b class=verse-num id=v15005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And this was their reply to us: &#8216;We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. <b class=verse-num id=v15005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia. <b class=verse-num id=v15005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt. <b class=verse-num id=v15005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; <b class=verse-num id=v15005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and he said to him, &#8220;Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is not yet finished.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v15005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if it seems good to the king, let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter.&#8221;</p></div>

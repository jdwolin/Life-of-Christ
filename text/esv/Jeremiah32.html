It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you. <b class=verse-num id=v24032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>You show steadfast love to thousands, but you repay the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts, <b class=verse-num id=v24032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds. <b class=verse-num id=v24032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day. <b class=verse-num id=v24032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror. <b class=verse-num id=v24032022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. <b class=verse-num id=v24032023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them. <b class=verse-num id=v24032024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it. <b class=verse-num id=v24032025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, &#8220;Buy the field for money and get witnesses&#8221;&#8212;though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p24032025_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v24032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <b class=verse-num id=v24032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh.

The children of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v24032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight <b class=verse-num id=v24032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger&#8212;their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v24032033-1>33&nbsp;</b>They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them persistently, they have not listened to receive instruction. <b class=verse-num id=v24032034-1>34&nbsp;</b>They set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. <b class=verse-num id=v24032035-1>35&nbsp;</b>They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p><h3 id=p24032035_12-1>They Shall Be My People; I Will Be Their God</h3><p id=p24032035_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v24032036-1>36&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, &#8216;It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence&#8217;: <b class=verse-num id=v24032037-1>37&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation.

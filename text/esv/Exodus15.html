And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v02014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>They said to Moses, &#8220;Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt? <b class=verse-num id=v02014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: &#8216;Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians&#8217;? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to the people, &#8220;Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again. <b class=verse-num id=v02014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.&#8221;</p><p id=p02014014_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward. <b class=verse-num id=v02014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground. <b class=verse-num id=v02014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. <b class=verse-num id=v02014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.&#8221;</p><p id=p02014018_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them, <b class=verse-num id=v02014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night without one coming near the other all night.</p><p id=p02014020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. <b class=verse-num id=v02014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. <b class=verse-num id=v02014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh&#8217;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. <b class=verse-num id=v02014024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic, <b class=verse-num id=v02014025-1>25&nbsp;</b>clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, &#8220;Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.&#8221;</p><p id=p02014025_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02014027-1>27&nbsp;</b>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD threw the Egyptians into the midst of the sea. <b class=verse-num id=v02014028-1>28&nbsp;</b>The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, not one of them remained. <b class=verse-num id=v02014029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</p><p id=p02014029_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v02014030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. <b class=verse-num id=v02014031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.</p></div>

And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, <b class=verse-num id=v02016023-1>23&nbsp;</b>he said to them, &#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded: &#8216;Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. <b class=verse-num id=v02016025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field. <b class=verse-num id=v02016026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.&#8221;</p><p id=p02016026_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016027-1>27&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. <b class=verse-num id=v02016028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? <b class=verse-num id=v02016029-1>29&nbsp;</b>See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016030-1>30&nbsp;</b>So the people rested on the seventh day.</p><p id=p02016030_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v02016031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. <b class=verse-num id=v02016032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Moses said, &#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded: &#8216;Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02016034-1>34&nbsp;</b>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. <b class=verse-num id=v02016035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. <b class=verse-num id=v02016036-1>36&nbsp;</b>(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)</p></div>

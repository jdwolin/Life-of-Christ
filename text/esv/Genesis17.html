When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth <b class=verse-num id=v01018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v01018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, <b class=verse-num id=v01018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on&#8212;since you have come to your servant.&#8221; So they said, &#8220;Do as you have said.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, &#8220;Quick!

The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah. <b class=verse-num id=v01018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, &#8220;After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Abraham, &#8220;Why did Sarah laugh and say, &#8216;Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v01018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Is anything too hard for the LORD?

<h3 id=p26011001_01-1>Judgment on Wicked Counselors</h3><p id=p26011001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26011001-1>11:1&nbsp;</b>The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. <b class=verse-num id=v26011002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city; <b class=verse-num id=v26011003-1>3&nbsp;</b>who say, &#8216;The time is not near to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26011004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man.&#8221;</p><p id=p26011004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26011005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, &#8220;Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind. <b class=verse-num id=v26011006-1>6&nbsp;</b>You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain. <b class=verse-num id=v26011007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it. <b class=verse-num id=v26011008-1>8&nbsp;</b>You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26011009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you. <b class=verse-num id=v26011010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26011011-1>11&nbsp;</b>This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v26011012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you.&#8221;</p><p id=p26011012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v26011013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, &#8220;Ah, Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26011013_05-1>Israel&#8217;s New Heart and Spirit</h3><p id=p26011013_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26011014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26011015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, &#8216;Go far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26011016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Therefore say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26011017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Therefore say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26011018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations. <b class=verse-num id=v26011019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, <b class=verse-num id=v26011020-1>20&nbsp;</b>that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. <b class=verse-num id=v26011021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</p><p id=p26011021_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26011022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. <b class=verse-num id=v26011023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city. <b class=verse-num id=v26011024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. <b class=verse-num id=v26011025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.</p></div>

You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house. <b class=verse-num id=v26012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile. <b class=verse-num id=v26012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it. <b class=verse-num id=v26012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p26012006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I did as I was commanded.

They shall go into exile, into captivity.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v26012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there. <b class=verse-num id=v26012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. <b class=verse-num id=v26012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries. <b class=verse-num id=v26012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p><p id=p26012016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And the word of the LORD came to me: <b class=verse-num id=v26012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety. <b class=verse-num id=v26012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink water in dismay.

They say, &#8216;Declares the LORD,&#8217; when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word. <b class=verse-num id=v26013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, &#8216;Declares the LORD,&#8217; although I have not spoken?&#8221;</p><p id=p26013007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, &#8216;Peace,&#8217; when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash, <b class=verse-num id=v26013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out. <b class=verse-num id=v26013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, &#8216;Where is the coating with which you smeared it?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v26013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end. <b class=verse-num id=v26013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it, <b class=verse-num id=v26013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.</p><p id=p26013016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them <b class=verse-num id=v26013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive? <b class=verse-num id=v26013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.</p><p id=p26013019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v26013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds. <b class=verse-num id=v26013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v26013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life, <b class=verse-num id=v26013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</p></div>

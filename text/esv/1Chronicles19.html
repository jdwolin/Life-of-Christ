<h3 id=p13019001_01-1>The Ammonites Disgrace David&#8217;s Men</h3><p id=p13019001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v13019001-1>19:1&nbsp;</b>Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place. <b class=verse-num id=v13019002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me.&#8221; So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David&#8217;s servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, &#8220;Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Hanun took David&#8217;s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away; <b class=verse-num id=v13019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, &#8220;Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.&#8221;</p><p id=p13019005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. <b class=verse-num id=v13019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle. <b class=verse-num id=v13019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. <b class=verse-num id=v13019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</p><h3 id=p13019009_06-1>Ammonites and Syrians Defeated</h3><p id=p13019009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians. <b class=verse-num id=v13019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites. <b class=verse-num id=v13019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. <b class=verse-num id=v13019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v13019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab&#8217;s brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p><p id=p13019015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v13019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. <b class=verse-num id=v13019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. <b class=verse-num id=v13019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army. <b class=verse-num id=v13019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to save the Ammonites anymore.</p></div>

But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab struck down Rabbah and overthrew it. <b class=verse-num id=v13020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And David took the crown of their king from his head.

And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. <b class=verse-num id=v13020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes.

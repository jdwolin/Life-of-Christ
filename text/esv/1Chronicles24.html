These four were the sons of Shimei. <b class=verse-num id=v13023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father&#8217;s house.</p><p id=p13023011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v13023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. <b class=verse-num id=v13023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to dedicate the most holy things, that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the LORD and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever. <b class=verse-num id=v13023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi. <b class=verse-num id=v13023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. <b class=verse-num id=v13023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. <b class=verse-num id=v13023017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief.

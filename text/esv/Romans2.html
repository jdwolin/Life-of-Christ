So they are without excuse. <b class=verse-num id=v45001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <b class=verse-num id=v45001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <b class=verse-num id=v45001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.</p><p id=p45001023_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v45001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, <b class=verse-num id=v45001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.</p><p id=p45001025_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v45001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <b class=verse-num id=v45001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</p><p id=p45001027_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v45001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. <b class=verse-num id=v45001029-1>29&nbsp;</b>They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, <b class=verse-num id=v45001030-1>30&nbsp;</b>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <b class=verse-num id=v45001031-1>31&nbsp;</b>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <b class=verse-num id=v45001032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Though they know God&#8217;s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45002001_01-1>God&#8217;s Righteous Judgment</h3><p id=p45002001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. <b class=verse-num id=v45002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. <b class=verse-num id=v45002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you suppose, O man&#8212;you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself&#8212;that you will escape the judgment of God? <b class=verse-num id=v45002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God&#8217;s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? <b class=verse-num id=v45002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God&#8217;s righteous judgment will be revealed.</p><p id=p45002005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He will render to each one according to his works: <b class=verse-num id=v45002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; <b class=verse-num id=v45002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. <b class=verse-num id=v45002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, <b class=verse-num id=v45002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. <b class=verse-num id=v45002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For God shows no partiality.</p><h3 id=p45002011_04-1>God&#8217;s Judgment and the Law</h3><p id=p45002011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. <b class=verse-num id=v45002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them <b class=verse-num id=v45002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</p><p id=p45002016_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God <b class=verse-num id=v45002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; <b class=verse-num id=v45002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <b class=verse-num id=v45002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? <b class=verse-num id=v45002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <b class=verse-num id=v45002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For, as it is written, &#8220;The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.&#8221;</p><p id=p45002024_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v45002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. <b class=verse-num id=v45002026-1>26&nbsp;</b>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? <b class=verse-num id=v45002027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45002028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. <b class=verse-num id=v45002029-1>29&nbsp;</b>But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</p></div>

<h3 id=p23036001_01-1>Sennacherib Invades Judah</h3><p id=p23036001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v23036001-1>36:1&nbsp;</b>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. <b class=verse-num id=v23036002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer&#8217;s Field. <b class=verse-num id=v23036003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.</p><p id=p23036003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v23036004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Say to Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours? <b class=verse-num id=v23036005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me? <b class=verse-num id=v23036006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. <b class=verse-num id=v23036007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But if you say to me, &#8220;We trust in the LORD our God,&#8221; is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, &#8220;You shall worship before this altar&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v23036008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. <b class=verse-num id=v23036009-1>9&nbsp;</b>How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master&#8217;s servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <b class=verse-num id=v23036010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, &#8220;Go up against this land and destroy it.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p23036010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v23036011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v23036012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the Rabshakeh said, &#8220;Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?&#8221;</p><p id=p23036012_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v23036013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: &#8220;Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! <b class=verse-num id=v23036014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Thus says the king: &#8216;Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you. <b class=verse-num id=v23036015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, &#8220;The LORD will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v23036016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern, <b class=verse-num id=v23036017-1>17&nbsp;</b>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. <b class=verse-num id=v23036018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, &#8220;The LORD will deliver us.&#8221; Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <b class=verse-num id=v23036019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v23036020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p23036020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v23036021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king&#8217;s command was, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v23036022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.</p></div>

They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning, <b class=verse-num id=v02036004-1>4&nbsp;</b>so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing, <b class=verse-num id=v02036005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and said to Moses, &#8220;The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v02036006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, &#8220;Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary.&#8221; So the people were restrained from bringing, <b class=verse-num id=v02036007-1>7&nbsp;</b>for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.</p><p id=p02036007_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v02036008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked. <b class=verse-num id=v02036009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size.</p><p id=p02036009_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v02036010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another. <b class=verse-num id=v02036011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set. <b class=verse-num id=v02036012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another. <b class=verse-num id=v02036013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole.</p><p id=p02036013_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v02036014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He also made curtains of goats&#8217; hair for a tent over the tabernacle.

The eleven curtains were the same size. <b class=verse-num id=v02036016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v02036017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain. <b class=verse-num id=v02036018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole. <b class=verse-num id=v02036019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams&#8217; skins and goatskins.</p><p id=p02036019_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v02036020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood. <b class=verse-num id=v02036021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame. <b class=verse-num id=v02036022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Each frame had two tenons for fitting together.

He made two of them this way for the two corners. <b class=verse-num id=v02036030-1>30&nbsp;</b>There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.</p><p id=p02036030_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v02036031-1>31&nbsp;</b>He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle, <b class=verse-num id=v02036032-1>32&nbsp;</b>and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward. <b class=verse-num id=v02036033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And he made the middle bar to run from end to end halfway up the frames. <b class=verse-num id=v02036034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</p><p id=p02036034_01-1><b class=verse-num id=v02036035-1>35&nbsp;</b>He made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; with cherubim skillfully worked into it he made it. <b class=verse-num id=v02036036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And for it he made four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver. <b class=verse-num id=v02036037-1>37&nbsp;</b>He also made a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, embroidered with needlework, <b class=verse-num id=v02036038-1>38&nbsp;</b>and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals, and their fillets were of gold, but their five bases were of bronze.</p></div>

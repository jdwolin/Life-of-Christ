You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. <b class=verse-num id=v52001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, <b class=verse-num id=v52001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. <b class=verse-num id=v52001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. <b class=verse-num id=v52001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, <b class=verse-num id=v52001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.</p></div>

<h3 id=p52002001_01-1>Paul&#8217;s Ministry to the Thessalonians</h3><p id=p52002001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v52002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain. <b class=verse-num id=v52002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict. <b class=verse-num id=v52002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive, <b class=verse-num id=v52002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts. <b class=verse-num id=v52002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed&#8212;God is witness. <b class=verse-num id=v52002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v52002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children. <b class=verse-num id=v52002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.</p><p id=p52002008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v52002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. <b class=verse-num id=v52002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers. <b class=verse-num id=v52002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For you know how, like a father with his children, <b class=verse-num id=v52002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</p><p id=p52002012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v52002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers. <b class=verse-num id=v52002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, <b class=verse-num id=v52002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind <b class=verse-num id=v52002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved&#8212;so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last!</p><h3 id=p52002016_06-1>Paul&#8217;s Longing to See Them Again</h3><p id=p52002016_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v52002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face, <b class=verse-num id=v52002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>because we wanted to come to you&#8212;I, Paul, again and again&#8212;but Satan hindered us. <b class=verse-num id=v52002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? <b class=verse-num id=v52002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For you are our glory and joy.</p></div>

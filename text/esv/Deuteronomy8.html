<h3 id=p05007001_01-1>A Chosen People</h3><p id=p05007001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05007001-1>7:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and mightier than you, <b class=verse-num id=v05007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and when the LORD your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them. <b class=verse-num id=v05007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons, <b class=verse-num id=v05007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. <b class=verse-num id=v05007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and chop down their Asherim and burn their carved images with fire.</p><p id=p05007005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v05007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, <b class=verse-num id=v05007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v05007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations, <b class=verse-num id=v05007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face. <b class=verse-num id=v05007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.</p><p id=p05007011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05007012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v05007013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you. <b class=verse-num id=v05007014-1>14&nbsp;</b>You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock. <b class=verse-num id=v05007015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you. <b class=verse-num id=v05007016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And you shall consume all the peoples that the LORD your God will give over to you. Your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.</p><p id=p05007016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05007017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;If you say in your heart, &#8216;These nations are greater than I. How can I dispossess them?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05007018-1>18&nbsp;</b>you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt, <b class=verse-num id=v05007019-1>19&nbsp;</b>the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. So will the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v05007020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Moreover, the LORD your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed. <b class=verse-num id=v05007021-1>21&nbsp;</b>You shall not be in dread of them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God. <b class=verse-num id=v05007022-1>22&nbsp;</b>The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little. You may not make an end of them at once, lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you. <b class=verse-num id=v05007023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed. <b class=verse-num id=v05007024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under heaven. No one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them. <b class=verse-num id=v05007025-1>25&nbsp;</b>The carved images of their gods you shall burn with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God. <b class=verse-num id=v05007026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest and abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction.</p></div>

<h3 id=p05009001_01-1>Not Because of Righteousness</h3><p id=p05009001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v05009001-1>9:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to heaven, <b class=verse-num id=v05009002-1>2&nbsp;</b>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, &#8216;Who can stand before the sons of Anak?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the LORD your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the LORD has promised you.</p><p id=p05009003_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v05009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them out before you, &#8216;It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,&#8217; whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you. <b class=verse-num id=v05009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p><p id=p05009005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v05009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Know, therefore, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people. <b class=verse-num id=v05009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v05009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you. <b class=verse-num id=v05009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. <b class=verse-num id=v05009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the LORD had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v05009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v05009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to me, &#8216;Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p05009012_05-1>The Golden Calf</h3><p id=p05009012_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Furthermore, the LORD said to me, &#8216;I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stubborn people. <b class=verse-num id=v05009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. <b class=verse-num id=v05009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God. You had made yourselves a golden calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you. <b class=verse-num id=v05009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v05009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v05009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the LORD bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me that time also. <b class=verse-num id=v05009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. <b class=verse-num id=v05009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain.</p><p id=p05009021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;At Taberah also, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath. <b class=verse-num id=v05009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, &#8216;Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,&#8217; then you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God and did not believe him or obey his voice. <b class=verse-num id=v05009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</p><p id=p05009024_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>&#8220;So I lay prostrate before the LORD for these forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said he would destroy you. <b class=verse-num id=v05009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And I prayed to the LORD, &#8216;O Lord GOD, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <b class=verse-num id=v05009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin, <b class=verse-num id=v05009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>lest the land from which you brought us say, &#8220;Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v05009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.&#8217;</p></div>

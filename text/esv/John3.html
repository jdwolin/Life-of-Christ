<h3 id=p43002001_01-1>The Wedding at Cana</h3><p id=p43002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v43002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. <b class=verse-num id=v43002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. <b class=verse-num id=v43002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, &#8220;They have no wine.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>His mother said to the servants, &#8220;Do whatever he tells you.&#8221;</p><p id=p43002005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. <b class=verse-num id=v43002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to the servants, <span class=woc>&#8220;Fill the jars with water.&#8221;</span> And they filled them up to the brim. <b class=verse-num id=v43002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.&#8221;</span> So they took it. <b class=verse-num id=v43002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom <b class=verse-num id=v43002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</p><p id=p43002011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.</p><h3 id=p43002012_05-1>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3><p id=p43002012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v43002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. <b class=verse-num id=v43002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. <b class=verse-num id=v43002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he told those who sold the pigeons, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take these things away; do not make my Father&#8217;s house a house of trade.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>His disciples remembered that it was written, &#8220;Zeal for your house will consume me.&#8221;</p><p id=p43002017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So the Jews said to him, &#8220;What sign do you show us for doing these things?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The Jews then said, &#8220;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But he was speaking about the temple of his body. <b class=verse-num id=v43002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</p><h3 id=p43002022_09-1>Jesus Knows What Is in Man</h3><p id=p43002022_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. <b class=verse-num id=v43002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people <b class=verse-num id=v43002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</p></div>

It was about the sixth hour.</p><p id=p43004006_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>A woman from Samaria came to draw water.

Where do you get that living water? <b class=verse-num id=v43004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to her, <span class=woc>&#8220;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.

Can this be the Christ?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004030-1>30&nbsp;</b>They went out of the town and were coming to him.</p><p id=p43004030_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v43004031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, eat.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;I have food to eat that you do not know about.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004033-1>33&nbsp;</b>So the disciples said to one another, &#8220;Has anyone brought him something to eat?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v43004035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do you not say, &#8216;There are yet four months, then comes the harvest&#8217;?

And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. <b class=verse-num id=v43004047-1>47&nbsp;</b>When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <b class=verse-num id=v43004048-1>48&nbsp;</b>So Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43004049-1>49&nbsp;</b>The official said to him, &#8220;Sir, come down before my child dies.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004050-1>50&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Go; your son will live.&#8221;</span> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. <b class=verse-num id=v43004051-1>51&nbsp;</b>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. <b class=verse-num id=v43004052-1>52&nbsp;</b>So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, &#8220;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43004053-1>53&nbsp;</b>The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Your son will live.&#8221;</span> And he himself believed, and all his household. <b class=verse-num id=v43004054-1>54&nbsp;</b>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14032001_01-1>Sennacherib Invades Judah</h3><p id=p14032001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14032001-1>32:1&nbsp;</b>After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them for himself. <b class=verse-num id=v14032002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v14032003-1>3&nbsp;</b>he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him. <b class=verse-num id=v14032004-1>4&nbsp;</b>A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, &#8220;Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14032005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He set to work resolutely and built up all the wall that was broken down and raised towers upon it, and outside it he built another wall, and he strengthened the Millo in the city of David. He also made weapons and shields in abundance. <b class=verse-num id=v14032006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he set combat commanders over the people and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14032007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him, for there are more with us than with him. <b class=verse-num id=v14032008-1>8&nbsp;</b>With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles.&#8221; And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p><h3 id=p14032008_04-1>Sennacherib Blasphemes</h3><p id=p14032008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032009-1>9&nbsp;</b>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14032010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, &#8216;On what are you trusting, that you endure the siege in Jerusalem? <b class=verse-num id=v14032011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, &#8220;The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v14032012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, &#8220;Before one altar you shall worship, and on it you shall burn your sacrifices&#8221;? <b class=verse-num id=v14032013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v14032014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers devoted to destruction was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand? <b class=verse-num id=v14032015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p14032015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And his servants said still more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah. <b class=verse-num id=v14032017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, &#8220;Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14032018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city. <b class=verse-num id=v14032019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men&#8217;s hands.</p><h3 id=p14032019_06-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Delivers Jerusalem</h3><p id=p14032019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v14032021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword. <b class=verse-num id=v14032022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies, and he provided for them on every side. <b class=verse-num id=v14032023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.</p><h3 id=p14032023_10-1>Hezekiah&#8217;s Pride and Achievements</h3><p id=p14032023_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032024-1>24&nbsp;</b>In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to the LORD, and he answered him and gave him a sign. <b class=verse-num id=v14032025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But Hezekiah did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14032026-1>26&nbsp;</b>But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p><p id=p14032026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels; <b class=verse-num id=v14032028-1>28&nbsp;</b>storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds. <b class=verse-num id=v14032029-1>29&nbsp;</b>He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions. <b class=verse-num id=v14032030-1>30&nbsp;</b>This same Hezekiah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. <b class=verse-num id=v14032031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart.</p><p id=p14032031_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v14032032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14032033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger. <b class=verse-num id=v14033007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, &#8220;In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever, <b class=verse-num id=v14033008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land that I appointed for your fathers, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the rules given through Moses.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14033009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.</p><h3 id=p14033009_05-1>Manasseh&#8217;s Repentance</h3><p id=p14033009_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14033010-1>10&nbsp;</b>The LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they paid no attention. <b class=verse-num id=v14033011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks and bound him with chains of bronze and brought him to Babylon. <b class=verse-num id=v14033012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And when he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14033013-1>13&nbsp;</b>He prayed to him, and God was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.</p><p id=p14033013_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14033014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of Gihon, in the valley, and for the entrance into the Fish Gate, and carried it around Ophel, and raised it to a very great height. He also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14033015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside of the city. <b class=verse-num id=v14033016-1>16&nbsp;</b>He also restored the altar of the LORD and offered on it sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and he commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14033017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.</p><p id=p14033017_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14033018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14033019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And his prayer, and how God was moved by his entreaty, and all his sin and his faithlessness, and the sites on which he built high places and set up the Asherim and the images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers. <b class=verse-num id=v14033020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house, and Amon his son reigned in his place.</p><h3 id=p14033020_07-1>Amon&#8217;s Reign and Death</h3><p id=p14033020_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v14033021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14033022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done.

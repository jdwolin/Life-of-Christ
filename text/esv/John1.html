Are you Elijah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; &#8220;Are you the Prophet?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;No.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So they said to him, &#8220;Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, &#8216;Make straight the way of the Lord,&#8217; as the prophet Isaiah said.&#8221;</p><p id=p43001023_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v43001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) <b class=verse-num id=v43001025-1>25&nbsp;</b>They asked him, &#8220;Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001026-1>26&nbsp;</b>John answered them, &#8220;I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, <b class=verse-num id=v43001027-1>27&nbsp;</b>even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001028-1>28&nbsp;</b>These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p><h3 id=p43001028_11-1>Behold, the Lamb of God</h3><p id=p43001028_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v43001029-1>29&nbsp;</b>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <b class=verse-num id=v43001030-1>30&nbsp;</b>This is he of whom I said, &#8216;After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v43001031-1>31&nbsp;</b>I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And John bore witness: &#8220;I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. <b class=verse-num id=v43001033-1>33&nbsp;</b>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, &#8216;He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v43001034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p43001034_16-1>Jesus Calls the First Disciples</h3><p id=p43001034_21-1><b class=verse-num id=v43001035-1>35&nbsp;</b>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, <b class=verse-num id=v43001036-1>36&nbsp;</b>and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001037-1>37&nbsp;</b>The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v43001038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;What are you seeking?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; (which means Teacher), &#8220;where are you staying?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001039-1>39&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Come and you will see.&#8221;</span> So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. <b class=verse-num id=v43001040-1>40&nbsp;</b>One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother. <b class=verse-num id=v43001041-1>41&nbsp;</b>He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, &#8220;We have found the Messiah&#8221; (which means Christ). <b class=verse-num id=v43001042-1>42&nbsp;</b>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;You are Simon the son of John.

He found Philip and said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43001044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. <b class=verse-num id=v43001045-1>45&nbsp;</b>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, &#8220;We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001046-1>46&nbsp;</b>Nathanael said to him, &#8220;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&#8221; Philip said to him, &#8220;Come and see.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43001047-1>47&nbsp;</b>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43001048-1>48&nbsp;</b>Nathanael said to him, &#8220;How do you know me?&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43001049-1>49&nbsp;</b>Nathanael answered him, &#8220;Rabbi, you are the Son of God!

My hour has not yet come.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>His mother said to the servants, &#8220;Do whatever he tells you.&#8221;</p><p id=p43002005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. <b class=verse-num id=v43002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to the servants, <span class=woc>&#8220;Fill the jars with water.&#8221;</span> And they filled them up to the brim. <b class=verse-num id=v43002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.&#8221;</span> So they took it. <b class=verse-num id=v43002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom <b class=verse-num id=v43002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and said to him, &#8220;Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</p><p id=p43002011_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.</p><h3 id=p43002012_05-1>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3><p id=p43002012_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v43002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. <b class=verse-num id=v43002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. <b class=verse-num id=v43002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he told those who sold the pigeons, <span class=woc>&#8220;Take these things away; do not make my Father&#8217;s house a house of trade.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>His disciples remembered that it was written, &#8220;Zeal for your house will consume me.&#8221;</p><p id=p43002017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>So the Jews said to him, &#8220;What sign do you show us for doing these things?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v43002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>The Jews then said, &#8220;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v43002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But he was speaking about the temple of his body. <b class=verse-num id=v43002022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</p><h3 id=p43002022_09-1>Jesus Knows What Is in Man</h3><p id=p43002022_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v43002023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. <b class=verse-num id=v43002024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people <b class=verse-num id=v43002025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</p></div>

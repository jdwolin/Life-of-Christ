Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p40024002_07-1>Signs of the End of the Age</h3><p id=p40024002_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v40024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, &#8220;Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;See that no one leads you astray.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024005-1>5&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For many will come in my name, saying, &#8216;I am the Christ,&#8217; and they will lead many astray.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024006-1>6&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024007-1>7&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.</span></p><p id=p40024008_14-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40024009-1>9&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name&#8217;s sake.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</span></p><h3 id=p40024014_14-1>The Abomination of Desolation</h3><p id=p40024014_18-1><b class=verse-num woc id=v40024015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024021-1>21&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40024022-1>22&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved.

Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40026056-1>56&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p><h3 id=p40026056_37-1>Jesus Before Caiaphas and the Council</h3><p id=p40026056_43-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026057-1>57&nbsp;</b>Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. <b class=verse-num id=v40026058-1>58&nbsp;</b>And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. <b class=verse-num id=v40026059-1>59&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, <b class=verse-num id=v40026060-1>60&nbsp;</b>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward <b class=verse-num id=v40026061-1>61&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;This man said, &#8216;I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026062-1>62&nbsp;</b>And the high priest stood up and said, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026063-1>63&nbsp;</b>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, &#8220;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026064-1>64&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;You have said so.

What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. <b class=verse-num id=v40026066-1>66&nbsp;</b>What is your judgment?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;He deserves death.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40026067-1>67&nbsp;</b>Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, <b class=verse-num id=v40026068-1>68&nbsp;</b>saying, &#8220;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?&#8221;</p><h3 id=p40026068_43-1>Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id=p40026068_46-1><b class=verse-num id=v40026069-1>69&nbsp;</b>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.

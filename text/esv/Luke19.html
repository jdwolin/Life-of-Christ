Will he delay long over them?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018008-1>8&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42018008_07-1>The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h3><p id=p42018008_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v42018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018011-1>11&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: &#8216;God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018012-1>12&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, &#8216;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42018014_13-1>Let the Children Come to Me</h3><p id=p42018014_19-1><b class=verse-num id=v42018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <b class=verse-num id=v42018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Jesus called them to him, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42018017_19-1>The Rich Ruler</h3><p id=p42018017_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v42018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And a ruler asked him, &#8220;Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>You know the commandments: &#8216;Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.&#8217;&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;All these I have kept from my youth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. <b class=verse-num id=v42018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, <span class=woc>&#8220;How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018025-1>25&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Those who heard it said, &#8220;Then who can be saved?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>But he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;What is impossible with man is possible with God.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And Peter said, &#8220;See, we have left our homes and followed you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018030-1>30&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42018030_22-1>Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time</h3><p id=p42018030_29-1><b class=verse-num id=v42018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And taking the twelve, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018032-1>32&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018033-1>33&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.</p><h3 id=p42018034_29-1>Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar</h3><p id=p42018034_34-1><b class=verse-num id=v42018035-1>35&nbsp;</b>As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. <b class=verse-num id=v42018036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. <b class=verse-num id=v42018037-1>37&nbsp;</b>They told him, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And he cried out, &#8220;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, &#8220;Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018040-1>40&nbsp;</b>And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, <b class=verse-num woc id=v42018041-1>41&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;What do you want me to do for you?&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;Lord, let me recover my sight.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42018042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42018043-1>43&nbsp;</b>And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</p></div>

He was a chief tax collector and was rich. <b class=verse-num id=v42019003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. <b class=verse-num id=v42019004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. <b class=verse-num id=v42019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v42019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. <b class=verse-num id=v42019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they saw it, they all grumbled, &#8220;He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#8220;Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019010-1>10&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42019010_04-1>The Parable of the Ten Minas</h3><p id=p42019010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. <b class=verse-num id=v42019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>He said therefore, <span class=woc>&#8220;A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019013-1>13&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, &#8216;Engage in business until I come.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019014-1>14&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, &#8216;We do not want this man to reign over us.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019015-1>15&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019016-1>16&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>The first came before him, saying, &#8216;Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.&#8217;</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v42019017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And he said to him, &#8216;Well done, good servant!

Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, &#8220;Teacher, rebuke your disciples.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v42019040-1>40&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p42019040_13-1>Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem</h3><p id=p42019040_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v42019041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, <b class=verse-num id=v42019042-1>42&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace!

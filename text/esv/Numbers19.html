<h3 id=p04018001_01-1>Duties of Priests and Levites</h3><p id=p04018001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v04018001-1>18:1&nbsp;</b>So the LORD said to Aaron, &#8220;You and your sons and your father&#8217;s house with you shall bear iniquity connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear iniquity connected with your priesthood. <b class=verse-num id=v04018002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And with you bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you and minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony. <b class=verse-num id=v04018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>They shall keep guard over you and over the whole tent, but shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary or to the altar lest they, and you, die. <b class=verse-num id=v04018004-1>4&nbsp;</b>They shall join you and keep guard over the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent, and no outsider shall come near you. <b class=verse-num id=v04018005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And you shall keep guard over the sanctuary and over the altar, that there may never again be wrath on the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v04018006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the people of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting. <b class=verse-num id=v04018007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood as a gift, and any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.&#8221;</p><p id=p04018007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04018008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, &#8220;Behold, I have given you charge of the contributions made to me, all the consecrated things of the people of Israel. I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual due. <b class=verse-num id=v04018009-1>9&nbsp;</b>This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every guilt offering of theirs, which they render to me, shall be most holy to you and to your sons. <b class=verse-num id=v04018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>In a most holy place shall you eat it. Every male may eat it; it is holy to you. <b class=verse-num id=v04018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>This also is yours: the contribution of their gift, all the wave offerings of the people of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it. <b class=verse-num id=v04018012-1>12&nbsp;</b>All the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the grain, the firstfruits of what they give to the LORD, I give to you. <b class=verse-num id=v04018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it. <b class=verse-num id=v04018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours. <b class=verse-num id=v04018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, whether man or beast, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours. Nevertheless, the firstborn of man you shall redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem. <b class=verse-num id=v04018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And their redemption price (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. <b class=verse-num id=v04018017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall burn their fat as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v04018018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But their flesh shall be yours, as the breast that is waved and as the right thigh are yours. <b class=verse-num id=v04018019-1>19&nbsp;</b>All the holy contributions that the people of Israel present to the LORD I give to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. It is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD for you and for your offspring with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04018020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Aaron, &#8220;You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the people of Israel.</p><p id=p04018020_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04018021-1>21&nbsp;</b>&#8220;To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service that they do, their service in the tent of meeting, <b class=verse-num id=v04018022-1>22&nbsp;</b>so that the people of Israel do not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and die. <b class=verse-num id=v04018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the people of Israel they shall have no inheritance. <b class=verse-num id=v04018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>For the tithe of the people of Israel, which they present as a contribution to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said of them that they shall have no inheritance among the people of Israel.&#8221;</p><p id=p04018024_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v04018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Moreover, you shall speak and say to the Levites, &#8216;When you take from the people of Israel the tithe that I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present a contribution from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe. <b class=verse-num id=v04018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And your contribution shall be counted to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress. <b class=verse-num id=v04018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So you shall also present a contribution to the LORD from all your tithes, which you receive from the people of Israel. And from it you shall give the LORD&#8217;s contribution to Aaron the priest. <b class=verse-num id=v04018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Out of all the gifts to you, you shall present every contribution due to the LORD; from each its best part is to be dedicated.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v04018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Therefore you shall say to them, &#8216;When you have offered from it the best of it, then the rest shall be counted to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor, and as produce of the winepress. <b class=verse-num id=v04018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And you may eat it in any place, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. <b class=verse-num id=v04018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have contributed the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, lest you die.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

And Miriam died there and was buried there.</p><h3 id=p04020001_05-1>The Waters of Meribah</h3><p id=p04020001_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Now there was no water for the congregation. And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <b class=verse-num id=v04020003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And the people quarreled with Moses and said, &#8220;Would that we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD! <b class=verse-num id=v04020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle? <b class=verse-num id=v04020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them, <b class=verse-num id=v04020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v04020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Moses took the staff from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</p><h3 id=p04020009_09-1>Moses Strikes the Rock</h3><p id=p04020009_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, &#8220;Hear now, you rebels: shall we bring water for you out of this rock?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, and water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock. <b class=verse-num id=v04020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>These are the waters of Meribah, where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and through them he showed himself holy.</p><h3 id=p04020013_13-1>Edom Refuses Passage</h3><p id=p04020013_16-1><b class=verse-num id=v04020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: &#8220;Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that we have met: <b class=verse-num id=v04020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v04020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. <b class=verse-num id=v04020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or drink water from a well. We will go along the King&#8217;s Highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>But Edom said to him, &#8220;You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v04020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel said to him, &#8220;We will go up by the highway, and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then I will pay for it.

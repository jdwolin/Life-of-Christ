<h3 id=p48001001_01-1>Greeting</h3><p id=p48001001_02-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48001001-1>1:1&nbsp;</b>Paul, an apostle&#8212;not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48001002-1>2&nbsp;</b>and all the brothers who are with me,</p><p id=p48001002_02-1>To the churches of Galatia:</p><p id=p48001002_02-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, <b class=verse-num id=v48001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, <b class=verse-num id=v48001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><h3 id=p48001005_02-1>No Other Gospel</h3><p id=p48001005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. <b class=verse-num id=v48001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</p><p id=p48001009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p><h3 id=p48001010_05-1>Paul Called by God</h3><p id=p48001010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man&#8217;s gospel. <b class=verse-num id=v48001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. <b class=verse-num id=v48001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v48001015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, <b class=verse-num id=v48001016-1>16&nbsp;</b>was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; <b class=verse-num id=v48001017-1>17&nbsp;</b>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</p><p id=p48001017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48001018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. <b class=verse-num id=v48001019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord&#8217;s brother. <b class=verse-num id=v48001020-1>20&nbsp;</b>(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) <b class=verse-num id=v48001021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <b class=verse-num id=v48001022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48001023-1>23&nbsp;</b>They only were hearing it said, &#8220;He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48001024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And they glorified God because of me.</p></div>

Certainly not! <b class=verse-num id=v48002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. <b class=verse-num id=v48002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. <b class=verse-num id=v48002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. <b class=verse-num id=v48002021-1>21&nbsp;</b>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.</p></div>

<h3 id=p48003001_01-1>By Faith, or by Works of the Law?</h3><p id=p48003001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v48003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. <b class=verse-num id=v48003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? <b class=verse-num id=v48003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? <b class=verse-num id=v48003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Did you suffer so many things in vain&#8212;if indeed it was in vain? <b class=verse-num id=v48003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>just as Abraham &#8220;believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness&#8221;?</p><p id=p48003006_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v48003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &#8220;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</p><h3 id=p48003009_09-1>The Righteous Shall Live by Faith</h3><p id=p48003009_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, &#8220;Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for &#8220;The righteous shall live by faith.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But the law is not of faith, rather &#8220;The one who does them shall live by them.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v48003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us&#8212;for it is written, &#8220;Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree&#8221;&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v48003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.</p><h3 id=p48003014_15-1>The Law and the Promise</h3><p id=p48003014_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. <b class=verse-num id=v48003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, &#8220;And to offsprings,&#8221; referring to many, but referring to one, &#8220;And to your offspring,&#8221; who is Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. <b class=verse-num id=v48003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</p><p id=p48003018_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. <b class=verse-num id=v48003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.</p><p id=p48003020_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. <b class=verse-num id=v48003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p><p id=p48003022_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v48003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. <b class=verse-num id=v48003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. <b class=verse-num id=v48003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, <b class=verse-num id=v48003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. <b class=verse-num id=v48003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v48003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v48003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And if you are Christ&#8217;s, then you are Abraham&#8217;s offspring, heirs according to promise.</p></div>

But you say, &#8220;How have you loved us?&#8221; &#8220;Is not Esau Jacob&#8217;s brother?&#8221; declares the LORD. &#8220;Yet I have loved Jacob <b class=verse-num id=v39001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v39001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>If Edom says, &#8220;We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,&#8221; the LORD of hosts says, &#8220;They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called &#8216;the wicked country,&#8217; and &#8216;the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v39001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, &#8220;Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p39001005_06-1>The Priests&#8217; Polluted Offerings</h3><p id=p39001005_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v39001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, &#8216;How have we despised your name?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v39001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, &#8216;How have we polluted you?&#8217; By saying that the LORD&#8217;s table may be despised. <b class=verse-num id=v39001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts. <b class=verse-num id=v39001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts. <b class=verse-num id=v39001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v39001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name will be great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts. <b class=verse-num id=v39001012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But you profane it when you say that the Lord&#8217;s table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised. <b class=verse-num id=v39001013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But you say, &#8216;What a weariness this is,&#8217; and you snort at it, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v39001014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name will be feared among the nations.</p></div>

<h3 id=p39002001_01-1>The <span class=divine-name>Lord</span> Rebukes the Priests</h3><p id=p39002001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v39002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now, O priests, this command is for you. <b class=verse-num id=v39002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart. <b class=verse-num id=v39002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it. <b class=verse-num id=v39002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may stand, says the LORD of hosts. <b class=verse-num id=v39002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name. <b class=verse-num id=v39002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. <b class=verse-num id=v39002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts. <b class=verse-num id=v39002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But you have turned aside from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts, <b class=verse-num id=v39002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p39002009_06-1>Judah Profaned the Covenant</h3><p id=p39002009_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v39002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? <b class=verse-num id=v39002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. <b class=verse-num id=v39002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man who does this, who brings an offering to the LORD of hosts!</p><p id=p39002012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v39002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And this second thing you do. You cover the LORD&#8217;s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v39002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But you say, &#8220;Why does he not?&#8221; Because the LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. <b class=verse-num id=v39002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth. <b class=verse-num id=v39002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the LORD, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be faithless.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p39002016_10-1>The Messenger of the <span class=divine-name>Lord</span></h3><p id=p39002016_15-1><b class=verse-num id=v39002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>You have wearied the LORD with your words. But you say, &#8220;How have we wearied him?&#8221; By saying, &#8220;Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them.&#8221; Or by asking, &#8220;Where is the God of justice?&#8221;</p></div>

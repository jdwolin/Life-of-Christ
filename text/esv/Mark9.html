And some of them have come from far away.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And his disciples answered him, &#8220;How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And he asked them, <span class=woc>&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Seven.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. <b class=verse-num id=v41008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them. <b class=verse-num id=v41008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. <b class=verse-num id=v41008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away. <b class=verse-num id=v41008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</p><h3 id=p41008010_06-1>The Pharisees Demand a Sign</h3><p id=p41008010_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v41008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. <b class=verse-num id=v41008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.</p><h3 id=p41008013_11-1>The Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod</h3><p id=p41008013_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v41008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. <b class=verse-num id=v41008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And he cautioned them, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. <b class=verse-num id=v41008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;Twelve.&#8221; <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>&#8220;And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Seven.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you not yet understand?&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41008021_18-1>Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida</h3><p id=p41008021_25-1><b class=verse-num id=v41008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. <b class=verse-num id=v41008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do you see anything?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And he looked up and said, &#8220;I see people, but they look like trees, walking.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. <b class=verse-num id=v41008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And he sent him to his home, saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;Do not even enter the village.&#8221;</span></p><h3 id=p41008026_25-1>Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</h3><p id=p41008026_31-1><b class=verse-num id=v41008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, <span class=woc>&#8220;Who do people say that I am?&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41008028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And they told him, &#8220;John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41008029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And he asked them, <span class=woc>&#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221;</span> Peter answered him, &#8220;You are the Christ.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41008030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.</p><h3 id=p41008030_31-1>Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3><p id=p41008030_37-1><b class=verse-num id=v41008031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. <b class=verse-num id=v41008032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. <b class=verse-num id=v41008033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.&#8221;</span></p><p id=p41008033_37-1><b class=verse-num id=v41008034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008035-1>35&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel&#8217;s will save it.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008036-1>36&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008037-1>37&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For what can a man give in return for his soul?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41008038-1>38&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&#8221;</span></p></div>

And he was transfigured before them, <b class=verse-num id=v41009003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them. <b class=verse-num id=v41009004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v41009005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. <b class=verse-num id=v41009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &#8220;This is my beloved Son; listen to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</p><p id=p41009008_03-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <b class=verse-num id=v41009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. <b class=verse-num id=v41009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And they asked him, &#8220;Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;Elijah does come first to restore all things.

So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v41009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And he answered them, <span class=woc>&#8220;O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you?

And he did not want anyone to know, <b class=verse-num id=v41009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v41009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p><h3 id=p41009032_16-1>Who Is the Greatest?</h3><p id=p41009032_20-1><b class=verse-num id=v41009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And they came to Capernaum.

And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, <b class=verse-num id=v41010033-1>33&nbsp;</b>saying, <span class=woc>&#8220;See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v41010034-1>34&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him.

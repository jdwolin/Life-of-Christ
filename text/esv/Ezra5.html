The letter was written in Aramaic and translated. <b class=verse-num id=v15004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows: <b class=verse-num id=v15004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites, <b class=verse-num id=v15004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River. <b class=verse-num id=v15004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>(This is a copy of the letter that they sent.) &#8220;To Artaxerxes the king: Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, send greeting. And now <b class=verse-num id=v15004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. <b class=verse-num id=v15004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now be it known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be impaired. <b class=verse-num id=v15004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to witness the king&#8217;s dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king, <b class=verse-num id=v15004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste. <b class=verse-num id=v15004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p15004016_10-1>The King Orders the Work to Cease</h3><p id=p15004016_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v15004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The king sent an answer: &#8220;To Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting. And now <b class=verse-num id=v15004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>the letter that you sent to us has been plainly read before me. <b class=verse-num id=v15004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And I made a decree, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city from of old has risen against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it. <b class=verse-num id=v15004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, custom, and toll were paid. <b class=verse-num id=v15004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Therefore make a decree that these men be made to cease, and that this city be not rebuilt, until a decree is made by me. <b class=verse-num id=v15004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And take care not to be slack in this matter. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the king?&#8221;</p><p id=p15004022_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v15004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then, when the copy of King Artaxerxes&#8217; letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their associates, they went in haste to the Jews at Jerusalem and by force and power made them cease. <b class=verse-num id=v15004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then the work on the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p></div>

It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands. <b class=verse-num id=v15005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus: &#8216;Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v15005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of their leaders. <b class=verse-num id=v15005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And this was their reply to us: &#8216;We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. <b class=verse-num id=v15005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia. <b class=verse-num id=v15005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt. <b class=verse-num id=v15005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; <b class=verse-num id=v15005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and he said to him, &#8220;Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v15005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is not yet finished.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v15005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Therefore, if it seems good to the king, let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem.

Its height shall be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits, <b class=verse-num id=v15006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>with three layers of great stones and one layer of timber.

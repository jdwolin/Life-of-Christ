Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v11013002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the man cried against the altar by the word of the LORD and said, &#8220;O altar, altar, thus says the LORD: &#8216;Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, &#8220;This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: &#8216;Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, &#8220;Seize him.&#8221; And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself. <b class=verse-num id=v11013005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v11013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.&#8221; And the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king&#8217;s hand was restored to him and became as it was before. <b class=verse-num id=v11013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the man of God said to the king, &#8220;If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place, <b class=verse-num id=v11013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>for so was it commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, &#8216;You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.</p><h3 id=p11013010_07-1>The Prophet&#8217;s Disobedience</h3><p id=p11013010_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now an old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king. <b class=verse-num id=v11013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And their father said to them, &#8220;Which way did he go?&#8221; And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone. <b class=verse-num id=v11013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And he said to his sons, &#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221; So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it. <b class=verse-num id=v11013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, &#8220;Are you the man of God who came from Judah?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I am.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then he said to him, &#8220;Come home with me and eat bread.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place, <b class=verse-num id=v11013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>for it was said to me by the word of the LORD, &#8216;You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, &#8220;I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, &#8216;Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.&#8217;&#8221; But he lied to him. <b class=verse-num id=v11013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.</p><p id=p11013019_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back. <b class=verse-num id=v11013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the command that the LORD your God commanded you, <b class=verse-num id=v11013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, &#8220;Eat no bread and drink no water,&#8221; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. <b class=verse-num id=v11013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body. <b class=verse-num id=v11013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.</p><p id=p11013025_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11013026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, &#8220;It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD spoke to him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he said to his sons, &#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221; And they saddled it. <b class=verse-num id=v11013028-1>28&nbsp;</b>And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey. <b class=verse-num id=v11013029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city to mourn and to bury him. <b class=verse-num id=v11013030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And he laid the body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, &#8220;Alas, my brother!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v11013031-1>31&nbsp;</b>And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, &#8220;When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. <b class=verse-num id=v11013032-1>32&nbsp;</b>For the saying that he called out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass.&#8221;</p><p id=p11013032_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v11013033-1>33&nbsp;</b>After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people. Any who would, he ordained to be priests of the high places. <b class=verse-num id=v11013034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.</p></div>

Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people. <b class=verse-num id=v11014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him.

She arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. <b class=verse-num id=v11014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Ahijah, &#8220;Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick.

Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with unbearable news for you. <b class=verse-num id=v11014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Go, tell Jeroboam, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: &#8220;Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel <b class=verse-num id=v11014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes, <b class=verse-num id=v11014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back, <b class=verse-num id=v11014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>therefore behold, I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will burn up the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone. <b class=verse-num id=v11014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat, for the LORD has spoken it.&#8221;&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v11014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Arise therefore, go to your house.

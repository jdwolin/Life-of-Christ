If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05019005-1>5&nbsp;</b>as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies&#8212;he may flee to one of these cities and live, <b class=verse-num id=v05019006-1>6&nbsp;</b>lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past. <b class=verse-num id=v05019007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities. <b class=verse-num id=v05019008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v05019009-1>9&nbsp;</b>provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways&#8212;then you shall add three other cities to these three, <b class=verse-num id=v05019010-1>10&nbsp;</b>lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.</p><p id=p05019010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities, <b class=verse-num id=v05019012-1>12&nbsp;</b>then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die. <b class=verse-num id=v05019013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that it may be well with you.</p><h3 id=p05019013_06-1>Property Boundaries</h3><p id=p05019013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You shall not move your neighbor&#8217;s landmark, which the men of old have set, in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.</p><h3 id=p05019014_08-1>Laws Concerning Witnesses</h3><p id=p05019014_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v05019015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed. Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established. <b class=verse-num id=v05019016-1>16&nbsp;</b>If a malicious witness arises to accuse a person of wrongdoing, <b class=verse-num id=v05019017-1>17&nbsp;</b>then both parties to the dispute shall appear before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days. <b class=verse-num id=v05019018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The judges shall inquire diligently, and if the witness is a false witness and has accused his brother falsely, <b class=verse-num id=v05019019-1>19&nbsp;</b>then you shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. <b class=verse-num id=v05019020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And the rest shall hear and fear, and shall never again commit any such evil among you. <b class=verse-num id=v05019021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Your eye shall not pity. It shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p></div>

Do not fear or panic or be in dread of them, <b class=verse-num id=v05020004-1>4&nbsp;</b>for the LORD your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05020005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying, &#8216;Is there any man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. <b class=verse-num id=v05020006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And is there any man who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit. <b class=verse-num id=v05020007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And is there any man who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05020008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, &#8216;Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his fellows melt like his own.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05020009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, then commanders shall be appointed at the head of the people.</p><p id=p05020009_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05020010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it. <b class=verse-num id=v05020011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And if it responds to you peaceably and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you. <b class=verse-num id=v05020012-1>12&nbsp;</b>But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it. <b class=verse-num id=v05020013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword, <b class=verse-num id=v05020014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but the women and the little ones, the livestock, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as plunder for yourselves. And you shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you. <b class=verse-num id=v05020015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thus you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here. <b class=verse-num id=v05020016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes, <b class=verse-num id=v05020017-1>17&nbsp;</b>but you shall devote them to complete destruction, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the LORD your God has commanded, <b class=verse-num id=v05020018-1>18&nbsp;</b>that they may not teach you to do according to all their abominable practices that they have done for their gods, and so you sin against the LORD your God.</p><p id=p05020018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05020019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. You may eat from them, but you shall not cut them down. Are the trees in the field human, that they should be besieged by you? <b class=verse-num id=v05020020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Only the trees that you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, that you may build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.</p></div>

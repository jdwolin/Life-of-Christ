This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. <b class=verse-num id=v44012004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. <b class=verse-num id=v44012005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</p><h3 id=p44012005_06-1>Peter Is Rescued</h3><p id=p44012005_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. <b class=verse-num id=v44012007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, &#8220;Get up quickly.&#8221; And the chains fell off his hands. <b class=verse-num id=v44012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And the angel said to him, &#8220;Dress yourself and put on your sandals.&#8221; And he did so. And he said to him, &#8220;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. <b class=verse-num id=v44012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him. <b class=verse-num id=v44012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>When Peter came to himself, he said, &#8220;Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.&#8221;</p><p id=p44012011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. <b class=verse-num id=v44012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. <b class=verse-num id=v44012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Recognizing Peter&#8217;s voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate. <b class=verse-num id=v44012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They said to her, &#8220;You are out of your mind.&#8221; But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, &#8220;It is his angel!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. <b class=verse-num id=v44012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, &#8220;Tell these things to James and to the brothers.&#8221; Then he departed and went to another place.</p><p id=p44012017_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. <b class=verse-num id=v44012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.</p><h3 id=p44012019_09-1>The Death of Herod</h3><p id=p44012019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king&#8217;s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king&#8217;s country for food. <b class=verse-num id=v44012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them. <b class=verse-num id=v44012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And the people were shouting, &#8220;The voice of a god, and not of a man!&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.</p><p id=p44012023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>But the word of God increased and multiplied.</p><p id=p44012024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v44012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark.</p></div>

And they had John to assist them. <b class=verse-num id=v44013006-1>6&nbsp;</b>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. <b class=verse-num id=v44013007-1>7&nbsp;</b>He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. <b class=verse-num id=v44013008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. <b class=verse-num id=v44013009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him <b class=verse-num id=v44013010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and said, &#8220;You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? <b class=verse-num id=v44013011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.&#8221; Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. <b class=verse-num id=v44013012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p><h3 id=p44013012_11-1>Paul and Barnabas at Antioch in Pisidia</h3><p id=p44013012_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v44013013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem, <b class=verse-num id=v44013014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. <b class=verse-num id=v44013015-1>15&nbsp;</b>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, &#8220;Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v44013016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:</p><p id=p44013016_18-1>&#8220;Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. <b class=verse-num id=v44013017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. <b class=verse-num id=v44013018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <b class=verse-num id=v44013019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. <b class=verse-num id=v44013020-1>20&nbsp;</b>All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v44013021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. <b class=verse-num id=v44013022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, &#8216;I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v44013023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Of this man&#8217;s offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. <b class=verse-num id=v44013024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v44013025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And as John was finishing his course, he said, &#8216;What do you suppose that I am?

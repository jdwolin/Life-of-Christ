<h3 id=p16008001_01-1>Ezra Reads the Law</h3><p id=p16008001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v16008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>And all the people gathered as one man into the square before the Water Gate. And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses that the LORD had commanded Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v16008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh month. <b class=verse-num id=v16008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law. <b class=verse-num id=v16008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand, and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand. <b class=verse-num id=v16008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people, and as he opened it all the people stood. <b class=verse-num id=v16008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, &#8220;Amen, Amen,&#8221; lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v16008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law, while the people remained in their places. <b class=verse-num id=v16008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.</p><h3 id=p16008008_05-1>This Day Is Holy</h3><p id=p16008008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v16008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, &#8220;This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.&#8221; For all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law. <b class=verse-num id=v16008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then he said to them, &#8220;Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, &#8220;Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.</p><h3 id=p16008012_09-1>Feast of Booths Celebrated</h3><p id=p16008012_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v16008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>On the second day the heads of fathers&#8217; houses of all the people, with the priests and the Levites, came together to Ezra the scribe in order to study the words of the Law. <b class=verse-num id=v16008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And they found it written in the Law that the LORD had commanded by Moses that the people of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month, <b class=verse-num id=v16008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and that they should proclaim it and publish it in all their towns and in Jerusalem, &#8220;Go out to the hills and bring branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make booths, as it is written.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim. <b class=verse-num id=v16008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And all the assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in the booths, for from the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the people of Israel had not done so. And there was very great rejoicing. <b class=verse-num id=v16008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. They kept the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.</p></div>

Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</p><p id=p16009005_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you. <b class=verse-num id=v16009007-1>7&nbsp;</b>You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. <b class=verse-num id=v16009008-1>8&nbsp;</b>You found his heart faithful before you, and made with him the covenant to give to his offspring the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite. And you have kept your promise, for you are righteous.</p><p id=p16009008_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea, <b class=verse-num id=v16009010-1>10&nbsp;</b>and performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted arrogantly against our fathers. And you made a name for yourself, as it is to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v16009011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And you divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on dry land, and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into mighty waters. <b class=verse-num id=v16009012-1>12&nbsp;</b>By a pillar of cloud you led them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night to light for them the way in which they should go. <b class=verse-num id=v16009013-1>13&nbsp;</b>You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right rules and true laws, good statutes and commandments, <b class=verse-num id=v16009014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and you made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded them commandments and statutes and a law by Moses your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v16009015-1>15&nbsp;</b>You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and you told them to go in to possess the land that you had sworn to give them.</p><p id=p16009015_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;But they and our fathers acted presumptuously and stiffened their neck and did not obey your commandments. <b class=verse-num id=v16009017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They refused to obey and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed among them, but they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them. <b class=verse-num id=v16009018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Even when they had made for themselves a golden calf and said, &#8216;This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,&#8217; and had committed great blasphemies, <b class=verse-num id=v16009019-1>19&nbsp;</b>you in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud to lead them in the way did not depart from them by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to light for them the way by which they should go. <b class=verse-num id=v16009020-1>20&nbsp;</b>You gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst. <b class=verse-num id=v16009021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.</p><p id=p16009021_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009022-1>22&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And you gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them every corner. So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan. <b class=verse-num id=v16009023-1>23&nbsp;</b>You multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, and you brought them into the land that you had told their fathers to enter and possess. <b class=verse-num id=v16009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>So the descendants went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. <b class=verse-num id=v16009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And they captured fortified cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all good things, cisterns already hewn, vineyards, olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</p><p id=p16009025_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. <b class=verse-num id=v16009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. And in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies. <b class=verse-num id=v16009028-1>28&nbsp;</b>But after they had rest they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies. <b class=verse-num id=v16009029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, which if a person does them, he shall live by them, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey. <b class=verse-num id=v16009030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. <b class=verse-num id=v16009031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.</p><p id=p16009031_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009032-1>32&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. <b class=verse-num id=v16009033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly. <b class=verse-num id=v16009034-1>34&nbsp;</b>Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them. <b class=verse-num id=v16009035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Even in their own kingdom, and amid your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works. <b class=verse-num id=v16009036-1>36&nbsp;</b>Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. <b class=verse-num id=v16009037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress.</p><p id=p16009037_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v16009038-1>38&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Because of all this we make a firm covenant in writing; on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.</p></div>

He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, <b class=verse-num id=v40014004-1>4&nbsp;</b>because John had been saying to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have her.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. <b class=verse-num id=v40014006-1>6&nbsp;</b>But when Herod&#8217;s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, <b class=verse-num id=v40014007-1>7&nbsp;</b>so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. <b class=verse-num id=v40014008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Prompted by her mother, she said, &#8220;Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. <b class=verse-num id=v40014010-1>10&nbsp;</b>He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, <b class=verse-num id=v40014011-1>11&nbsp;</b>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. <b class=verse-num id=v40014012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.</p><h3 id=p40014012_07-1>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h3><p id=p40014012_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v40014013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. <b class=verse-num id=v40014014-1>14&nbsp;</b>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. <b class=verse-num id=v40014015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, &#8220;This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But Jesus said, <span class=woc>&#8220;They need not go away; you give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40014017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They said to him, &#8220;We have only five loaves here and two fish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40014018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Bring them here to me.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40014019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v40014020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. <b class=verse-num id=v40014021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p><h3 id=p40014021_12-1>Jesus Walks on the Water</h3><p id=p40014021_17-1><b class=verse-num id=v40014022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v40014023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.

And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But Peter said to him, &#8220;Explain the parable to us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he said, <span class=woc>&#8220;Are you also still without understanding?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40015017-1>17&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled?</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40015018-1>18&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40015019-1>19&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.</span> <b class=verse-num woc id=v40015020-1>20&nbsp;</b><span class=woc>These are what defile a person.

And his disciples came and begged him, saying, &#8220;Send her away, for she is crying out after us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015024-1>24&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015025-1>25&nbsp;</b>But she came and knelt before him, saying, &#8220;Lord, help me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And he answered, <span class=woc>&#8220;It is not right to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015027-1>27&nbsp;</b>She said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus answered her, <span class=woc>&#8220;O woman, great is your faith!

And they glorified the God of Israel.</p><h3 id=p40015031_17-1>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</h3><p id=p40015031_22-1><b class=verse-num id=v40015032-1>32&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <span class=woc>&#8220;I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.&#8221;</span> <b class=verse-num id=v40015033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the disciples said to him, &#8220;Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class=woc>&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Seven, and a few small fish.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v40015035-1>35&nbsp;</b>And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground, <b class=verse-num id=v40015036-1>36&nbsp;</b>he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. <b class=verse-num id=v40015037-1>37&nbsp;</b>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. <b class=verse-num id=v40015038-1>38&nbsp;</b>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. <b class=verse-num id=v40015039-1>39&nbsp;</b>And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.</p></div>

The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening. <b class=verse-num id=v26046003-1>3&nbsp;</b>The people of the land shall bow down at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons. <b class=verse-num id=v26046004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish. <b class=verse-num id=v26046005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah. <b class=verse-num id=v26046006-1>6&nbsp;</b>On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish. <b class=verse-num id=v26046007-1>7&nbsp;</b>As a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah. <b class=verse-num id=v26046008-1>8&nbsp;</b>When the prince enters, he shall enter by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.</p><p id=p26046008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26046009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate, and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead. <b class=verse-num id=v26046010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When they enter, the prince shall enter with them, and when they go out, he shall go out.</p><p id=p26046010_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26046011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah. <b class=verse-num id=v26046012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.</p><p id=p26046012_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26046013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;You shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it. <b class=verse-num id=v26046014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a grain offering to the LORD. This is a perpetual statute. <b class=verse-num id=v26046015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a regular burnt offering.</p><p id=p26046015_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26046016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons. It is their property by inheritance. <b class=verse-num id=v26046017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty. Then it shall revert to the prince; surely it is his inheritance&#8212;it shall belong to his sons. <b class=verse-num id=v26046018-1>18&nbsp;</b>The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be scattered from his property.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26046018_06-1>Boiling Places for Offerings</h3><p id=p26046018_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26046019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests, and behold, a place was there at the extreme western end of them. <b class=verse-num id=v26046020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so transmit holiness to the people.&#8221;</p><p id=p26046020_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26046021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me around to the four corners of the court. And behold, in each corner of the court there was another court&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v26046022-1>22&nbsp;</b>in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size. <b class=verse-num id=v26046023-1>23&nbsp;</b>On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around. <b class=verse-num id=v26046024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Then he said to me, &#8220;These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p26047001_01-1>Water Flowing from the Temple</h3><p id=p26047001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v26047001-1>47:1&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v26047002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.</p><p id=p26047002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v26047003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep. <b class=verse-num id=v26047004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep. <b class=verse-num id=v26047005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. <b class=verse-num id=v26047006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen this?&#8221;</p><p id=p26047006_06-1>Then he led me back to the bank of the river. <b class=verse-num id=v26047007-1>7&nbsp;</b>As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. <b class=verse-num id=v26047008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh. <b class=verse-num id=v26047009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. <b class=verse-num id=v26047010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. <b class=verse-num id=v26047011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. <b class=verse-num id=v26047012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p26047012_06-1>Division of the Land</h3><p id=p26047012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26047013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Thus says the Lord GOD: &#8220;This is the boundary by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions. <b class=verse-num id=v26047014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And you shall divide equally what I swore to give to your fathers. This land shall fall to you as your inheritance.</p><p id=p26047014_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v26047015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&#8220;This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, and on to Zedad, <b class=verse-num id=v26047016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Berothah, Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. <b class=verse-num id=v26047017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-enan, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north.

<h3 id=p09026001_01-1>David Spares Saul Again</h3><p id=p09026001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09026001-1>26:1&nbsp;</b>Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &#8220;Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. <b class=verse-num id=v09026003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness, <b class=verse-num id=v09026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come. <b class=verse-num id=v09026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.</p><p id=p09026005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab&#8217;s brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, &#8220;Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?&#8221; And Abishai said, &#8220;I will go down with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him. <b class=verse-num id=v09026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Abishai said to David, &#8220;God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But David said to Abishai, &#8220;Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed and be guiltless?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and perish. <b class=verse-num id=v09026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The LORD forbid that I should put out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed. But take now the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let us go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul&#8217;s head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.</p><p id=p09026012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them. <b class=verse-num id=v09026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, &#8220;Will you not answer, Abner?&#8221; Then Abner answered, &#8220;Who are you who calls to the king?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abner, &#8220;Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord. <b class=verse-num id=v09026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD&#8217;s anointed. And now see where the king&#8217;s spear is and the jar of water that was at his head.&#8221;</p><p id=p09026016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Saul recognized David&#8217;s voice and said, &#8220;Is this your voice, my son David?&#8221; And David said, &#8220;It is my voice, my lord, O king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is on my hands? <b class=verse-num id=v09026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering, but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, &#8216;Go, serve other gods.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.&#8221;</p><p id=p09026020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, &#8220;I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and have made a great mistake.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David answered and said, &#8220;Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and take it. <b class=verse-num id=v09026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed. <b class=verse-num id=v09026024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to David, &#8220;Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them.&#8221; So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09027001_01-1>David Flees to the Philistines</h3><p id=p09027001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09027001-1>27:1&nbsp;</b>Then David said in his heart, &#8220;Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09027002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So David arose and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. <b class=verse-num id=v09027003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal&#8217;s widow. <b class=verse-num id=v09027004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.</p><p id=p09027004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09027005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Achish, &#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So that day Achish gave him Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v09027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.</p><p id=p09027007_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v09027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Now David and his men went up and made raids against the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v09027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the garments, and come back to Achish. <b class=verse-num id=v09027010-1>10&nbsp;</b>When Achish asked, &#8220;Where have you made a raid today?&#8221; David would say, &#8220;Against the Negeb of Judah,&#8221; or, &#8220;Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites,&#8221; or, &#8220;Against the Negeb of the Kenites.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09027011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, &#8220;lest they should tell about us and say, &#8216;So David has done.&#8217;&#8221; Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v09027012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Achish trusted David, thinking, &#8220;He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p09028001_01-1>Saul and the Medium of En-dor</h3><p id=p09028001_07-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09028001-1>28:1&nbsp;</b>In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, &#8220;Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028002-1>2&nbsp;</b>David said to Achish, &#8220;Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.&#8221; And Achish said to David, &#8220;Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.&#8221;</p><p id=p09028002_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09028003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the necromancers out of the land. <b class=verse-num id=v09028004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa. <b class=verse-num id=v09028005-1>5&nbsp;</b>When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. <b class=verse-num id=v09028006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v09028007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to his servants, &#8220;Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.&#8221; And his servants said to him, &#8220;Behold, there is a medium at En-dor.&#8221;</p><p id=p09028007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09028008-1>8&nbsp;</b>So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said, &#8220;Divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028009-1>9&nbsp;</b>The woman said to him, &#8220;Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land. Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But Saul swore to her by the LORD, &#8220;As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Then the woman said, &#8220;Whom shall I bring up for you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Bring up Samuel for me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028012-1>12&nbsp;</b>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you deceived me? You are Saul.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The king said to her, &#8220;Do not be afraid. What do you see?&#8221; And the woman said to Saul, &#8220;I see a god coming up out of the earth.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028014-1>14&nbsp;</b>He said to her, &#8220;What is his appearance?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.&#8221; And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.</p><p id=p09028014_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09028015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?&#8221; Saul answered, &#8220;I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said, &#8220;Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy? <b class=verse-num id=v09028017-1>17&nbsp;</b>The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me, for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David. <b class=verse-num id=v09028018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day. <b class=verse-num id=v09028019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Moreover, the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;</p><p id=p09028019_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v09028020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night. <b class=verse-num id=v09028021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, &#8220;Behold, your servant has obeyed you. I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you have said to me. <b class=verse-num id=v09028022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, you also obey your servant. Let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09028023-1>23&nbsp;</b>He refused and said, &#8220;I will not eat.&#8221; But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to their words. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed. <b class=verse-num id=v09028024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it, <b class=verse-num id=v09028025-1>25&nbsp;</b>and she put it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.</p></div>

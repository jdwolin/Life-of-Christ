<h3 id=p46004001_01-1>The Ministry of Apostles</h3><p id=p46004001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. <b class=verse-num id=v46004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. <b class=verse-num id=v46004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. <b class=verse-num id=v46004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.</p><p id=p46004005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another. <b class=verse-num id=v46004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?</p><p id=p46004007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you! <b class=verse-num id=v46004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. <b class=verse-num id=v46004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>We are fools for Christ&#8217;s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. <b class=verse-num id=v46004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, <b class=verse-num id=v46004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; <b class=verse-num id=v46004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.</p><p id=p46004013_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v46004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. <b class=verse-num id=v46004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. <b class=verse-num id=v46004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>I urge you, then, be imitators of me. <b class=verse-num id=v46004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. <b class=verse-num id=v46004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. <b class=verse-num id=v46004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power. <b class=verse-num id=v46004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. <b class=verse-num id=v46004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?</p></div>

Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.</p><p id=p46005002_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46005003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. <b class=verse-num id=v46005004-1>4&nbsp;</b>When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v46005005-1>5&nbsp;</b>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p><p id=p46005005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? <b class=verse-num id=v46005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. <b class=verse-num id=v46005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p><p id=p46005008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v46005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v46005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. <b class=verse-num id=v46005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler&#8212;not even to eat with such a one. <b class=verse-num id=v46005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? <b class=verse-num id=v46005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>God judges those outside. &#8220;Purge the evil person from among you.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p46006001_01-1>Lawsuits Against Believers</h3><p id=p46006001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v46006001-1>6:1&nbsp;</b>When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? <b class=verse-num id=v46006002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? <b class=verse-num id=v46006003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life! <b class=verse-num id=v46006004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church? <b class=verse-num id=v46006005-1>5&nbsp;</b>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers, <b class=verse-num id=v46006006-1>6&nbsp;</b>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? <b class=verse-num id=v46006007-1>7&nbsp;</b>To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? <b class=verse-num id=v46006008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But you yourselves wrong and defraud&#8212;even your own brothers!</p><p id=p46006008_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v46006009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, <b class=verse-num id=v46006010-1>10&nbsp;</b>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. <b class=verse-num id=v46006011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p><h3 id=p46006011_04-1>Flee Sexual Immorality</h3><p id=p46006011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v46006012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;All things are lawful for me,&#8221; but not all things are helpful. &#8220;All things are lawful for me,&#8221; but I will not be dominated by anything. <b class=verse-num id=v46006013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food&#8221;&#8212;and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. <b class=verse-num id=v46006014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. <b class=verse-num id=v46006015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! <b class=verse-num id=v46006016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v46006017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. <b class=verse-num id=v46006018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. <b class=verse-num id=v46006019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, <b class=verse-num id=v46006020-1>20&nbsp;</b>for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.</p></div>

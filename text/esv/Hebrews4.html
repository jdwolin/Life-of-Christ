And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.</p><h3 id=p58003006_05-1>A Rest for the People of God</h3><p id=p58003006_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v58003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58003007_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Today, if you hear his voice,</span><br /><span id=p58003008_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,</span><br /><span id=p58003008_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the day of testing in the wilderness,</span><br /><span id=p58003009_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;where your fathers put me to the test</span><br /><span id=p58003009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and saw my works for forty years.</span><br /><span id=p58003010_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I was provoked with that generation,</span><br /><span id=p58003010_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, &#8216;They always go astray in their heart;</span><br /><span id=p58003010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have not known my ways.&#8217;</span><br /><span id=p58003011_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v58003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I swore in my wrath,</span><br /><span id=p58003011_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8216;They shall not enter my rest.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58003011_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. <b class=verse-num id=v58003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called &#8220;today,&#8221; that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. <b class=verse-num id=v58003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. <b class=verse-num id=v58003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>As it is said,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p58003015_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Today, if you hear his voice,</span><br /><span id=p58003015_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p58003015_12-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v58003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>For who were those who heard and yet rebelled?

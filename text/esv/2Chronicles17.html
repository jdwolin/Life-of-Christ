<h3 id=p14016001_01-1>Asa&#8217;s Last Years</h3><p id=p14016001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14016001-1>16:1&nbsp;</b>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14016002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king&#8217;s house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v14016003-1>3&nbsp;</b>&#8220;There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14016004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. <b class=verse-num id=v14016005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease. <b class=verse-num id=v14016006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.</p><p id=p14016006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14016007-1>7&nbsp;</b>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, &#8220;Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you. <b class=verse-num id=v14016008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v14016009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14016010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.</p><p id=p14016010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v14016011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14016012-1>12&nbsp;</b>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians. <b class=verse-num id=v14016013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign. <b class=verse-num id=v14016014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer&#8217;s art, and they made a very great fire in his honor.</p></div>

He did not seek the Baals, <b class=verse-num id=v14017004-1>4&nbsp;</b>but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14017005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor. <b class=verse-num id=v14017006-1>6&nbsp;</b>His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. And furthermore, he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.</p><p id=p14017006_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14017007-1>7&nbsp;</b>In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; <b class=verse-num id=v14017008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram. <b class=verse-num id=v14017009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.</p><p id=p14017009_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14017010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat. <b class=verse-num id=v14017011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats. <b class=verse-num id=v14017012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities, <b class=verse-num id=v14017013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14017014-1>14&nbsp;</b>This was the muster of them by fathers&#8217; houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor; <b class=verse-num id=v14017015-1>15&nbsp;</b>and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000; <b class=verse-num id=v14017016-1>16&nbsp;</b>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the LORD, with 200,000 mighty men of valor. <b class=verse-num id=v14017017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield; <b class=verse-num id=v14017018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 armed for war. <b class=verse-num id=v14017019-1>19&nbsp;</b>These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</p></div>

And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v14018003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, &#8220;Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?&#8221; He answered him, &#8220;I am as you are, my people as your people.

And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. <b class=verse-num id=v14018010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, &#8216;With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And all the prophets prophesied so and said, &#8220;Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph.

Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Micaiah said, &#8220;As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, &#8220;Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But the king said to him, &#8220;How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd.

The LORD has declared disaster concerning you.&#8221;</p><p id=p14018022_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14018023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, &#8220;Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Micaiah said, &#8220;Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel said, &#8220;Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&#8217;s son, <b class=verse-num id=v14018026-1>26&nbsp;</b>and say, &#8216;Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.&#8217;&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Micaiah said, &#8220;If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Hear, all you peoples!&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14018027_05-1>The Defeat and Death of Ahab</h3><p id=p14018027_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v14018028-1>28&nbsp;</b>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. <b class=verse-num id=v14018029-1>29&nbsp;</b>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.&#8221; And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle. <b class=verse-num id=v14018030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, &#8220;Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018031-1>31&nbsp;</b>As soon as the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, &#8220;It is the king of Israel.&#8221; So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; God drew them away from him. <b class=verse-num id=v14018032-1>32&nbsp;</b>For as soon as the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. <b class=verse-num id=v14018033-1>33&nbsp;</b>But a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, &#8220;Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14018034-1>34&nbsp;</b>And the battle continued that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. Then at sunset he died.</p></div>

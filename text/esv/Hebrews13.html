God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? <b class=verse-num id=v58012008-1>8&nbsp;</b>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. <b class=verse-num id=v58012009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? <b class=verse-num id=v58012010-1>10&nbsp;</b>For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. <b class=verse-num id=v58012011-1>11&nbsp;</b>For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</p><p id=p58012011_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v58012012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, <b class=verse-num id=v58012013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. <b class=verse-num id=v58012014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v58012015-1>15&nbsp;</b>See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no &#8220;root of bitterness&#8221; springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; <b class=verse-num id=v58012016-1>16&nbsp;</b>that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. <b class=verse-num id=v58012017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.</p><h3 id=p58012017_12-1>A Kingdom That Cannot Be Shaken</h3><p id=p58012017_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v58012018-1>18&nbsp;</b>For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest <b class=verse-num id=v58012019-1>19&nbsp;</b>and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. <b class=verse-num id=v58012020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For they could not endure the order that was given, &#8220;If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58012021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, &#8220;I tremble with fear.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58012022-1>22&nbsp;</b>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, <b class=verse-num id=v58012023-1>23&nbsp;</b>and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, <b class=verse-num id=v58012024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.</p><p id=p58012024_18-1><b class=verse-num id=v58012025-1>25&nbsp;</b>See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v58012026-1>26&nbsp;</b>At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, &#8220;Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v58012027-1>27&nbsp;</b>This phrase, &#8220;Yet once more,&#8221; indicates the removal of things that are shaken&#8212;that is, things that have been made&#8212;in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain. <b class=verse-num id=v58012028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, <b class=verse-num id=v58012029-1>29&nbsp;</b>for our God is a consuming fire.</p></div>

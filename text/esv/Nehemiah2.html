And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v16001003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And they said to me, &#8220;The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p16001003_04-1>Nehemiah&#8217;s Prayer</h3><p id=p16001003_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v16001004-1>4&nbsp;</b>As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v16001005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I said, &#8220;O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, <b class=verse-num id=v16001006-1>6&nbsp;</b>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father&#8217;s house have sinned. <b class=verse-num id=v16001007-1>7&nbsp;</b>We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses. <b class=verse-num id=v16001008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, &#8216;If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples, <b class=verse-num id=v16001009-1>9&nbsp;</b>but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v16001010-1>10&nbsp;</b>They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. <b class=verse-num id=v16001011-1>11&nbsp;</b>O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.&#8221;</p><p id=p16001011_06-1>Now I was cupbearer to the king.</p></div>

<h3 id=p16002001_01-1>Nehemiah Sent to Judah</h3><p id=p16002001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v16002001-1>2:1&nbsp;</b>In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence. <b class=verse-num id=v16002002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And the king said to me, &#8220;Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart.&#8221; Then I was very much afraid. <b class=verse-num id=v16002003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I said to the king, &#8220;Let the king live forever! Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&#8217; graves, lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16002004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Then the king said to me, &#8220;What are you requesting?&#8221; So I prayed to the God of heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v16002005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I said to the king, &#8220;If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers&#8217; graves, that I may rebuild it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16002006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), &#8220;How long will you be gone, and when will you return?&#8221; So it pleased the king to send me when I had given him a time. <b class=verse-num id=v16002007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And I said to the king, &#8220;If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah, <b class=verse-num id=v16002008-1>8&nbsp;</b>and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king&#8217;s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.&#8221; And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.</p><h3 id=p16002008_05-1>Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem&#8217;s Walls</h3><p id=p16002008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v16002009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king&#8217;s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. <b class=verse-num id=v16002010-1>10&nbsp;</b>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel.</p><p id=p16002010_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v16002011-1>11&nbsp;</b>So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days. <b class=verse-num id=v16002012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode. <b class=verse-num id=v16002013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. <b class=verse-num id=v16002014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King&#8217;s Pool, but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass. <b class=verse-num id=v16002015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. <b class=verse-num id=v16002016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest who were to do the work.</p><p id=p16002016_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v16002017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Then I said to them, &#8220;You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer derision.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16002018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And I told them of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good, and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, &#8220;Let us rise up and build.&#8221; So they strengthened their hands for the good work. <b class=verse-num id=v16002019-1>19&nbsp;</b>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they jeered at us and despised us and said, &#8220;What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v16002020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then I replied to them, &#8220;The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or claim in Jerusalem.&#8221;</p></div>

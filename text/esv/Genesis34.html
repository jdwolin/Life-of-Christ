So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants. <b class=verse-num id=v01033002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. <b class=verse-num id=v01033003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p><p id=p01033003_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033004-1>4&nbsp;</b>But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. <b class=verse-num id=v01033005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, &#8220;Who are these with you?&#8221; Jacob said, &#8220;The children whom God has graciously given your servant.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down. <b class=verse-num id=v01033007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down. <b class=verse-num id=v01033008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Esau said, &#8220;What do you mean by all this company that I met?&#8221; Jacob answered, &#8220;To find favor in the sight of my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But Esau said, &#8220;I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, &#8220;No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me. <b class=verse-num id=v01033011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.&#8221; Thus he urged him, and he took it.</p><p id=p01033011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then Esau said, &#8220;Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033013-1>13&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to him, &#8220;My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die. <b class=verse-num id=v01033014-1>14&nbsp;</b>Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.&#8221;</p><p id=p01033014_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033015-1>15&nbsp;</b>So Esau said, &#8220;Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01033016-1>16&nbsp;</b>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. <b class=verse-num id=v01033017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</p><p id=p01033017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v01033018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city. <b class=verse-num id=v01033019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem&#8217;s father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent. <b class=verse-num id=v01033020-1>20&nbsp;</b>There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.</p></div>

He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. <b class=verse-num id=v01034004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, &#8220;Get me this girl for my wife.&#8221;</p><p id=p01034004_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came. <b class=verse-num id=v01034006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01034007-1>7&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob&#8217;s daughter, for such a thing must not be done.</p><p id=p01034007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034008-1>8&nbsp;</b>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, &#8220;The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v01034009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. <b class=verse-num id=v01034010-1>10&nbsp;</b>You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01034011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, &#8220;Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. <b class=verse-num id=v01034012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Ask me for as great a bride-price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.&#8221;</p><p id=p01034012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034013-1>13&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah. <b class=verse-num id=v01034014-1>14&nbsp;</b>They said to them, &#8220;We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. <b class=verse-num id=v01034015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Only on this condition will we agree with you&#8212;that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v01034016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people. <b class=verse-num id=v01034017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.&#8221;</p><p id=p01034017_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor&#8217;s son Shechem. <b class=verse-num id=v01034019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob&#8217;s daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father&#8217;s house. <b class=verse-num id=v01034020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, <b class=verse-num id=v01034021-1>21&nbsp;</b>&#8220;These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them.

Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01034024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.</p><p id=p01034024_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034025-1>25&nbsp;</b>On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&#8217;s brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males. <b class=verse-num id=v01034026-1>26&nbsp;</b>They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem&#8217;s house and went away. <b class=verse-num id=v01034027-1>27&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. <b class=verse-num id=v01034028-1>28&nbsp;</b>They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. <b class=verse-num id=v01034029-1>29&nbsp;</b>All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.</p><p id=p01034029_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v01034030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &#8220;You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01034031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But they said, &#8220;Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?&#8221;</p></div>

<h3 id=p01035001_01-1>God Blesses and Renames Jacob</h3><p id=p01035001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v01035001-1>35:1&nbsp;</b>God said to Jacob, &#8220;Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &#8220;Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. <b class=verse-num id=v01035003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035004-1>4&nbsp;</b>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.</p><p id=p01035004_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. <b class=verse-num id=v01035006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, <b class=verse-num id=v01035007-1>7&nbsp;</b>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother. <b class=verse-num id=v01035008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And Deborah, Rebekah&#8217;s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.</p><p id=p01035008_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v01035009-1>9&nbsp;</b>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. <b class=verse-num id=v01035010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And God said to him, &#8220;Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.&#8221; So he called his name Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v01035011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And God said to him, &#8220;I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. <b class=verse-num id=v01035012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. <b class=verse-num id=v01035014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone.

When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor. <b class=verse-num id=v01035017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, &#8220;Do not fear, for you have another son.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v01035018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin. <b class=verse-num id=v01035019-1>19&nbsp;</b>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem), <b class=verse-num id=v01035020-1>20&nbsp;</b>and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb.

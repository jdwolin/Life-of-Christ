And be thankful. <b class=verse-num id=v51003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. <b class=verse-num id=v51003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p><h3 id=p51003017_06-1>Rules for Christian Households</h3><p id=p51003017_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v51003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v51003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. <b class=verse-num id=v51003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v51003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged. <b class=verse-num id=v51003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. <b class=verse-num id=v51003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, <b class=verse-num id=v51003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. <b class=verse-num id=v51003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.</p></div>

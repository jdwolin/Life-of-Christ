For you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up into the mountain. He said:</p><p id=p05005005_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.</p><p id=p05005006_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;You shall have no other gods before me.</p><p id=p05005007_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. <b class=verse-num id=v05005009-1>9&nbsp;</b>You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, <b class=verse-num id=v05005010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p><p id=p05005010_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</p><p id=p05005011_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you. <b class=verse-num id=v05005013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Six days you shall labor and do all your work, <b class=verse-num id=v05005014-1>14&nbsp;</b>but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. <b class=verse-num id=v05005015-1>15&nbsp;</b>You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</p><p id=p05005015_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.</p><p id=p05005016_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;You shall not murder.</p><p id=p05005017_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;And you shall not commit adultery.</p><p id=p05005018_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;And you shall not steal.</p><p id=p05005019_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;And you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</p><p id=p05005020_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;And you shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s wife.

And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. <b class=verse-num id=v05005023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And as soon as you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders. <b class=verse-num id=v05005024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And you said, &#8216;Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live. <b class=verse-num id=v05005025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, we shall die. <b class=verse-num id=v05005026-1>26&nbsp;</b>For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have, and has still lived? <b class=verse-num id=v05005027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Go near and hear all that the LORD our God will say, and speak to us all that the LORD our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do it.&#8217;</p><p id=p05005027_04-1><b class=verse-num id=v05005028-1>28&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And the LORD heard your words, when you spoke to me. And the LORD said to me, &#8216;I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They are right in all that they have spoken. <b class=verse-num id=v05005029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Oh that they had such a heart as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, that it might go well with them and with their descendants forever! <b class=verse-num id=v05005030-1>30&nbsp;</b>Go and say to them, &#8220;Return to your tents.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v05005031-1>31&nbsp;</b>But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you the whole commandment and the statutes and the rules that you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v05005032-1>32&nbsp;</b>You shall be careful therefore to do as the LORD your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. <b class=verse-num id=v05005033-1>33&nbsp;</b>You shall walk in all the way that the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you shall possess.</p></div>

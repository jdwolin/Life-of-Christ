His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. <b class=verse-num id=v14026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.</p><p id=p14026005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v14026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. <b class=verse-num id=v14026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites. <b class=verse-num id=v14026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. <b class=verse-num id=v14026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them. <b class=verse-num id=v14026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And he built towers in the wilderness and cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. <b class=verse-num id=v14026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king&#8217;s commanders. <b class=verse-num id=v14026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>The whole number of the heads of fathers&#8217; houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600. <b class=verse-num id=v14026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. <b class=verse-num id=v14026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging. <b class=verse-num id=v14026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>In Jerusalem he made machines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.</p><h3 id=p14026015_05-1>Uzziah&#8217;s Pride and Punishment</h3><p id=p14026015_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. <b class=verse-num id=v14026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor, <b class=verse-num id=v14026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, &#8220;It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense. <b class=verse-num id=v14026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him. <b class=verse-num id=v14026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king&#8217;s household, governing the people of the land.</p><p id=p14026021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote. <b class=verse-num id=v14026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, &#8220;He is a leper.&#8221; And Jotham his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

His mother&#8217;s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. <b class=verse-num id=v14027002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah had done, except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still followed corrupt practices. <b class=verse-num id=v14027003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD and did much building on the wall of Ophel. <b class=verse-num id=v14027004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills. <b class=verse-num id=v14027005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents of silver, and 10,000 cors of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years. <b class=verse-num id=v14027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done, <b class=verse-num id=v14028002-1>2&nbsp;</b>but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made metal images for the Baals, <b class=verse-num id=v14028003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and he made offerings in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14028004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.</p><h3 id=p14028004_05-1>Judah Defeated</h3><p id=p14028004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force. <b class=verse-num id=v14028006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 from Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14028007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king&#8217;s son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king.</p><p id=p14028007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The men of Israel took captive 200,000 of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters. They also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v14028009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded, and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, &#8220;Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have killed them in a rage that has reached up to heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v14028010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God? <b class=verse-num id=v14028011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now hear me, and send back the captives from your relatives whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.&#8221;</p><p id=p14028011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war <b class=verse-num id=v14028013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14028014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v14028015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them. They clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them, and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.</p><p id=p14028015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help. <b class=verse-num id=v14028017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried away captives. <b class=verse-num id=v14028018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there. <b class=verse-num id=v14028019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah act sinfully and had been very unfaithful to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14028020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him. <b class=verse-num id=v14028021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.</p><h3 id=p14028021_07-1>Ahaz&#8217;s Idolatry</h3><p id=p14028021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028022-1>22&nbsp;</b>In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD&#8212;this same King Ahaz. <b class=verse-num id=v14028023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, &#8220;Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.&#8221; But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14028024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14028025-1>25&nbsp;</b>In every city of Judah he made high places to make offerings to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14028026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14028027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

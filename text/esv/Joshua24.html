<h3 id=p06023001_01-1>Joshua&#8217;s Charge to Israel&#8217;s Leaders</h3><p id=p06023001_06-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v06023001-1>23:1&nbsp;</b>A long time afterward, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years, <b class=verse-num id=v06023002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders and heads, its judges and officers, and said to them, &#8220;I am now old and well advanced in years. <b class=verse-num id=v06023003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the LORD your God who has fought for you. <b class=verse-num id=v06023004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west. <b class=verse-num id=v06023005-1>5&nbsp;</b>The LORD your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you. <b class=verse-num id=v06023006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Therefore, be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left, <b class=verse-num id=v06023007-1>7&nbsp;</b>that you may not mix with these nations remaining among you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them, <b class=verse-num id=v06023008-1>8&nbsp;</b>but you shall cling to the LORD your God just as you have done to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v06023009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For the LORD has driven out before you great and strong nations. And as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day. <b class=verse-num id=v06023010-1>10&nbsp;</b>One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the LORD your God who fights for you, just as he promised you. <b class=verse-num id=v06023011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Be very careful, therefore, to love the LORD your God. <b class=verse-num id=v06023012-1>12&nbsp;</b>For if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you and make marriages with them, so that you associate with them and they with you, <b class=verse-num id=v06023013-1>13&nbsp;</b>know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you, but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground that the LORD your God has given you.</p><p id=p06023013_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06023014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed. <b class=verse-num id=v06023015-1>15&nbsp;</b>But just as all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the LORD your God has given you, <b class=verse-num id=v06023016-1>16&nbsp;</b>if you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that he has given to you.&#8221;</p></div>

And they presented themselves before God. <b class=verse-num id=v06024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, &#8216;Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods. <b class=verse-num id=v06024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac. <b class=verse-num id=v06024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. <b class=verse-num id=v06024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.</p><p id=p06024005_06-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>&#8220;&#8216;Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. <b class=verse-num id=v06024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time. <b class=verse-num id=v06024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. <b class=verse-num id=v06024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you, <b class=verse-num id=v06024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand. <b class=verse-num id=v06024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v06024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow. <b class=verse-num id=v06024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.&#8217;</p><h3 id=p06024013_06-1>Choose Whom You Will Serve</h3><p id=p06024013_11-1><b class=verse-num id=v06024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.

And he took a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v06024027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD that he spoke to us.

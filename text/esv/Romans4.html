<h3 id=p45003001_01-1>God&#8217;s Righteousness Upheld</h3><p id=p45003001_04-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45003001-1>3:1&nbsp;</b>Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? <b class=verse-num id=v45003002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. <b class=verse-num id=v45003003-1>3&nbsp;</b>What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? <b class=verse-num id=v45003004-1>4&nbsp;</b>By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45003004_04-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;That you may be justified in your words,</span><br /><span id=p45003004_04-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prevail when you are judged.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45003004_04-1 class=same-paragraph><b class=verse-num id=v45003005-1>5&nbsp;</b>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) <b class=verse-num id=v45003006-1>6&nbsp;</b>By no means! For then how could God judge the world? <b class=verse-num id=v45003007-1>7&nbsp;</b>But if through my lie God&#8217;s truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? <b class=verse-num id=v45003008-1>8&nbsp;</b>And why not do evil that good may come?&#8212;as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.</p><h3 id=p45003008_04-1>No One Is Righteous</h3><p id=p45003008_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45003009-1>9&nbsp;</b>What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, <b class=verse-num id=v45003010-1>10&nbsp;</b>as it is written:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45003010_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;None is righteous, no, not one;</span><br /><span id=p45003011_08-1 class=indent line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one understands;</span><br /><span id=p45003011_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one seeks for God.</span><br /><span id=p45003012_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003012-1>12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;</span><br /><span id=p45003012_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one does good,</span><br /><span id=p45003012_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not even one.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45003013_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003013-1>13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Their throat is an open grave;</span><br /><span id=p45003013_08-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they use their tongues to deceive.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45003013_08-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The venom of asps is under their lips.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45003014_08-1 class=indent line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003014-1>14&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45003015_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003015-1>15&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span><br /><span id=p45003016_08-1 class=indent line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003016-1>16&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their paths are ruin and misery,</span><br /><span id=p45003017_08-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003017-1>17&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;and the way of peace they have not known.&#8221;</span><br /><span id=p45003018_08-1 class=indent line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45003018-1>18&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45003018_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v45003019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. <b class=verse-num id=v45003020-1>20&nbsp;</b>For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.</p><h3 id=p45003020_08-1>The Righteousness of God Through Faith</h3><p id=p45003020_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v45003021-1>21&nbsp;</b>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it&#8212;<b class=verse-num id=v45003022-1>22&nbsp;</b>the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: <b class=verse-num id=v45003023-1>23&nbsp;</b>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, <b class=verse-num id=v45003024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, <b class=verse-num id=v45003025-1>25&nbsp;</b>whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God&#8217;s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. <b class=verse-num id=v45003026-1>26&nbsp;</b>It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p><p id=p45003026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v45003027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. <b class=verse-num id=v45003028-1>28&nbsp;</b>For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. <b class=verse-num id=v45003029-1>29&nbsp;</b>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, <b class=verse-num id=v45003030-1>30&nbsp;</b>since God is one&#8212;who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. <b class=verse-num id=v45003031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</p></div>

<h3 id=p45004001_01-1>Abraham Justified by Faith</h3><p id=p45004001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v45004001-1>4:1&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? <b class=verse-num id=v45004002-1>2&nbsp;</b>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. <b class=verse-num id=v45004003-1>3&nbsp;</b>For what does the Scripture say? &#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. <b class=verse-num id=v45004005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, <b class=verse-num id=v45004006-1>6&nbsp;</b>just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p45004007_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45004007-1>7&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</span><br /><span id=p45004007_05-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose sins are covered;</span><br /><span id=p45004008_05-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v45004008-1>8&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.&#8221;</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p45004008_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. <b class=verse-num id=v45004010-1>10&nbsp;</b>How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. <b class=verse-num id=v45004011-1>11&nbsp;</b>He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, <b class=verse-num id=v45004012-1>12&nbsp;</b>and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</p><h3 id=p45004012_05-1>The Promise Realized Through Faith</h3><p id=p45004012_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004013-1>13&nbsp;</b>For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. <b class=verse-num id=v45004014-1>14&nbsp;</b>For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. <b class=verse-num id=v45004015-1>15&nbsp;</b>For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</p><p id=p45004015_10-1><b class=verse-num id=v45004016-1>16&nbsp;</b>That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring&#8212;not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, <b class=verse-num id=v45004017-1>17&nbsp;</b>as it is written, &#8220;I have made you the father of many nations&#8221;&#8212;in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. <b class=verse-num id=v45004018-1>18&nbsp;</b>In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, &#8220;So shall your offspring be.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah&#8217;s womb. <b class=verse-num id=v45004020-1>20&nbsp;</b>No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, <b class=verse-num id=v45004021-1>21&nbsp;</b>fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. <b class=verse-num id=v45004022-1>22&nbsp;</b>That is why his faith was &#8220;counted to him as righteousness.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v45004023-1>23&nbsp;</b>But the words &#8220;it was counted to him&#8221; were not written for his sake alone, <b class=verse-num id=v45004024-1>24&nbsp;</b>but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, <b class=verse-num id=v45004025-1>25&nbsp;</b>who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</p></div>

For if many died through one man&#8217;s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. <b class=verse-num id=v45005016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And the free gift is not like the result of that one man&#8217;s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. <b class=verse-num id=v45005017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For if, because of one man&#8217;s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</p><p id=p45005017_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v45005018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. <b class=verse-num id=v45005019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For as by the one man&#8217;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&#8217;s obedience the many will be made righteous. <b class=verse-num id=v45005020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, <b class=verse-num id=v45005021-1>21&nbsp;</b>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p></div>

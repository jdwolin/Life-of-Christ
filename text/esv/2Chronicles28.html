His mother&#8217;s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. <b class=verse-num id=v14027002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah had done, except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still followed corrupt practices. <b class=verse-num id=v14027003-1>3&nbsp;</b>He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD and did much building on the wall of Ophel. <b class=verse-num id=v14027004-1>4&nbsp;</b>Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills. <b class=verse-num id=v14027005-1>5&nbsp;</b>He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents of silver, and 10,000 cors of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years. <b class=verse-num id=v14027006-1>6&nbsp;</b>So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God. <b class=verse-num id=v14027007-1>7&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. <b class=verse-num id=v14027008-1>8&nbsp;</b>He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14027009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

<h3 id=p14028001_01-1>Ahaz Reigns in Judah</h3><p id=p14028001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v14028001-1>28:1&nbsp;</b>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done, <b class=verse-num id=v14028002-1>2&nbsp;</b>but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made metal images for the Baals, <b class=verse-num id=v14028003-1>3&nbsp;</b>and he made offerings in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned his sons as an offering, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14028004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And he sacrificed and made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.</p><h3 id=p14028004_05-1>Judah Defeated</h3><p id=p14028004_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force. <b class=verse-num id=v14028006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 from Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14028007-1>7&nbsp;</b>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king&#8217;s son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king.</p><p id=p14028007_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028008-1>8&nbsp;</b>The men of Israel took captive 200,000 of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters. They also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria. <b class=verse-num id=v14028009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded, and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, &#8220;Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have killed them in a rage that has reached up to heaven. <b class=verse-num id=v14028010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God? <b class=verse-num id=v14028011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Now hear me, and send back the captives from your relatives whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.&#8221;</p><p id=p14028011_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war <b class=verse-num id=v14028013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v14028014-1>14&nbsp;</b>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly. <b class=verse-num id=v14028015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them. They clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them, and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.</p><p id=p14028015_07-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028016-1>16&nbsp;</b>At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help. <b class=verse-num id=v14028017-1>17&nbsp;</b>For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried away captives. <b class=verse-num id=v14028018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there. <b class=verse-num id=v14028019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah act sinfully and had been very unfaithful to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14028020-1>20&nbsp;</b>So Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him. <b class=verse-num id=v14028021-1>21&nbsp;</b>For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.</p><h3 id=p14028021_07-1>Ahaz&#8217;s Idolatry</h3><p id=p14028021_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14028022-1>22&nbsp;</b>In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD&#8212;this same King Ahaz. <b class=verse-num id=v14028023-1>23&nbsp;</b>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, &#8220;Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.&#8221; But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14028024-1>24&nbsp;</b>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. <b class=verse-num id=v14028025-1>25&nbsp;</b>In every city of Judah he made high places to make offerings to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers. <b class=verse-num id=v14028026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14028027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</p></div>

His mother&#8217;s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. <b class=verse-num id=v14029002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.</p><h3 id=p14029002_05-1>Hezekiah Cleanses the Temple</h3><p id=p14029002_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14029003-1>3&nbsp;</b>In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them. <b class=verse-num id=v14029004-1>4&nbsp;</b>He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east <b class=verse-num id=v14029005-1>5&nbsp;</b>and said to them, &#8220;Hear me, Levites! Now consecrate yourselves, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth from the Holy Place. <b class=verse-num id=v14029006-1>6&nbsp;</b>For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD and turned their backs. <b class=verse-num id=v14029007-1>7&nbsp;</b>They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14029008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Therefore the wrath of the LORD came on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v14029009-1>9&nbsp;</b>For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. <b class=verse-num id=v14029010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us. <b class=verse-num id=v14029011-1>11&nbsp;</b>My sons, do not now be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him.&#8221;</p><p id=p14029011_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v14029012-1>12&nbsp;</b>Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; <b class=verse-num id=v14029013-1>13&nbsp;</b>and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; <b class=verse-num id=v14029014-1>14&nbsp;</b>and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. <b class=verse-num id=v14029015-1>15&nbsp;</b>They gathered their brothers and consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14029016-1>16&nbsp;</b>The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it and carried it out to the brook Kidron. <b class=verse-num id=v14029017-1>17&nbsp;</b>They began to consecrate on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD. Then for eight days they consecrated the house of the LORD, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished. <b class=verse-num id=v14029018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, &#8220;We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the showbread and all its utensils. <b class=verse-num id=v14029019-1>19&nbsp;</b>All the utensils that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and consecrated, and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p14029019_09-1>Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship</h3><p id=p14029019_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14029020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14029021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14029022-1>22&nbsp;</b>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and threw it against the altar. And they slaughtered the rams, and their blood was thrown against the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs, and their blood was thrown against the altar. <b class=verse-num id=v14029023-1>23&nbsp;</b>Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them, <b class=verse-num id=v14029024-1>24&nbsp;</b>and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</p><p id=p14029024_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14029025-1>25&nbsp;</b>And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king&#8217;s seer and of Nathan the prophet, for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets. <b class=verse-num id=v14029026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. <b class=verse-num id=v14029027-1>27&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD began also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel. <b class=verse-num id=v14029028-1>28&nbsp;</b>The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished. <b class=verse-num id=v14029029-1>29&nbsp;</b>When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped. <b class=verse-num id=v14029030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah the king and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.</p><p id=p14029030_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v14029031-1>31&nbsp;</b>Then Hezekiah said, &#8220;You have now consecrated yourselves to the LORD. Come near; bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.&#8221; And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings. <b class=verse-num id=v14029032-1>32&nbsp;</b>The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. <b class=verse-num id=v14029033-1>33&nbsp;</b>And the consecrated offerings were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v14029034-1>34&nbsp;</b>But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so until other priests had consecrated themselves, their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was finished&#8212;for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves. <b class=verse-num id=v14029035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Besides the great number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored. <b class=verse-num id=v14029036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had provided for the people, for the thing came about suddenly.</p></div>

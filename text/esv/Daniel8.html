Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. <b class=verse-num id=v27007002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Daniel declared, &#8220;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. <b class=verse-num id=v27007003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. <b class=verse-num id=v27007004-1>4&nbsp;</b>The first was like a lion and had eagles&#8217; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v27007005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &#8216;Arise, devour much flesh.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v27007006-1>6&nbsp;</b>After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. <b class=verse-num id=v27007007-1>7&nbsp;</b>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. <b class=verse-num id=v27007008-1>8&nbsp;</b>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p><h3 id=p27007008_07-1>The Ancient of Days Reigns</h3><p id=p27007008_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v27007009-1>9&nbsp;</b>&#8220;As I looked,</p><p class=block-indent><span class=begin-line-group></span><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;thrones were placed,</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Ancient of Days took his seat;</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;his clothing was white as snow,</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hair of his head like pure wool;</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;his throne was fiery flames;</span><br /><span id=p27007009_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its wheels were burning fire.</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=line><b class=verse-num inline id=v27007010-1>10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream of fire issued</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and came out from before him;</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;a thousand thousands served him,</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=line>&nbsp;&nbsp;the court sat in judgment,</span><br /><span id=p27007010_12-1 class=indent line>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the books were opened.</span><br /><span class=end-line-group></span></p><p id=p27007010_12-1><b class=verse-num id=v27007011-1>11&nbsp;</b>&#8220;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking.

<h3 id=p27008001_01-1>Daniel&#8217;s Vision of the Ram and the Goat</h3><p id=p27008001_09-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v27008001-1>8:1&nbsp;</b>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. <b class=verse-num id=v27008002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the citadel, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal. <b class=verse-num id=v27008003-1>3&nbsp;</b>I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. <b class=verse-num id=v27008004-1>4&nbsp;</b>I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</p><p id=p27008004_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008005-1>5&nbsp;</b>As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. <b class=verse-num id=v27008006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath. <b class=verse-num id=v27008007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. <b class=verse-num id=v27008008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.</p><p id=p27008008_09-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008009-1>9&nbsp;</b>Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. <b class=verse-num id=v27008010-1>10&nbsp;</b>It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. <b class=verse-num id=v27008011-1>11&nbsp;</b>It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. <b class=verse-num id=v27008012-1>12&nbsp;</b>And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper. <b class=verse-num id=v27008013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, &#8220;For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27008014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, &#8220;For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.&#8221;</p><h3 id=p27008014_09-1>The Interpretation of the Vision</h3><p id=p27008014_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008015-1>15&nbsp;</b>When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. <b class=verse-num id=v27008016-1>16&nbsp;</b>And I heard a man&#8217;s voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, &#8220;Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v27008017-1>17&nbsp;</b>So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, &#8220;Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.&#8221;</p><p id=p27008017_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up. <b class=verse-num id=v27008019-1>19&nbsp;</b>He said, &#8220;Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end. <b class=verse-num id=v27008020-1>20&nbsp;</b>As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. <b class=verse-num id=v27008021-1>21&nbsp;</b>And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king. <b class=verse-num id=v27008022-1>22&nbsp;</b>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power. <b class=verse-num id=v27008023-1>23&nbsp;</b>And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise. <b class=verse-num id=v27008024-1>24&nbsp;</b>His power shall be great&#8212;but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints. <b class=verse-num id=v27008025-1>25&nbsp;</b>By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken&#8212;but by no human hand. <b class=verse-num id=v27008026-1>26&nbsp;</b>The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.&#8221;</p><p id=p27008026_14-1><b class=verse-num id=v27008027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king&#8217;s business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it.</p></div>

Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.</p><h3 id=p27009023_10-1>The Seventy Weeks</h3><p id=p27009023_13-1><b class=verse-num id=v27009024-1>24&nbsp;</b>&#8220;Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. <b class=verse-num id=v27009025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. <b class=verse-num id=v27009026-1>26&nbsp;</b>And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. <b class=verse-num id=v27009027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.&#8221;</p></div>

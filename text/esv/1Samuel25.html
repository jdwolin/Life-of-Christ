<h3 id=p09024001_01-1>David Spares Saul&#8217;s Life</h3><p id=p09024001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09024001-1>24:1&nbsp;</b>When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, &#8220;Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09024002-1>2&nbsp;</b>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats&#8217; Rocks. <b class=verse-num id=v09024003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. <b class=verse-num id=v09024004-1>4&nbsp;</b>And the men of David said to him, &#8220;Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, &#8216;Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.&#8217;&#8221; Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe. <b class=verse-num id=v09024005-1>5&nbsp;</b>And afterward David&#8217;s heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe. <b class=verse-num id=v09024006-1>6&nbsp;</b>He said to his men, &#8220;The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD&#8217;s anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09024007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.</p><p id=p09024007_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09024008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221; And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage. <b class=verse-num id=v09024009-1>9&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Why do you listen to the words of men who say, &#8216;Behold, David seeks your harm&#8217;? <b class=verse-num id=v09024010-1>10&nbsp;</b>Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, &#8216;I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09024011-1>11&nbsp;</b>See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it. <b class=verse-num id=v09024012-1>12&nbsp;</b>May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you. <b class=verse-num id=v09024013-1>13&nbsp;</b>As the proverb of the ancients says, &#8216;Out of the wicked comes wickedness.&#8217; But my hand shall not be against you. <b class=verse-num id=v09024014-1>14&nbsp;</b>After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea! <b class=verse-num id=v09024015-1>15&nbsp;</b>May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.&#8221;</p><p id=p09024015_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09024016-1>16&nbsp;</b>As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, &#8220;Is this your voice, my son David?&#8221; And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. <b class=verse-num id=v09024017-1>17&nbsp;</b>He said to David, &#8220;You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil. <b class=verse-num id=v09024018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands. <b class=verse-num id=v09024019-1>19&nbsp;</b>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day. <b class=verse-num id=v09024020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand. <b class=verse-num id=v09024021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Swear to me therefore by the LORD that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09024022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09025001_01-1>The Death of Samuel</h3><p id=p09025001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09025001-1>25:1&nbsp;</b>Now Samuel died. And all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah.</p><h3 id=p09025001_05-1>David and Abigail</h3><p id=p09025001_08-1> Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. <b class=verse-num id=v09025002-1>2&nbsp;</b>And there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel. <b class=verse-num id=v09025003-1>3&nbsp;</b>Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was discerning and beautiful, but the man was harsh and badly behaved; he was a Calebite. <b class=verse-num id=v09025004-1>4&nbsp;</b>David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v09025005-1>5&nbsp;</b>So David sent ten young men. And David said to the young men, &#8220;Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal and greet him in my name. <b class=verse-num id=v09025006-1>6&nbsp;</b>And thus you shall greet him: &#8216;Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have. <b class=verse-num id=v09025007-1>7&nbsp;</b>I hear that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel. <b class=verse-num id=v09025008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p id=p09025008_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025009-1>9&nbsp;</b>When David&#8217;s young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David, and then they waited. <b class=verse-num id=v09025010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And Nabal answered David&#8217;s servants, &#8220;Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters. <b class=verse-num id=v09025011-1>11&nbsp;</b>Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men who come from I do not know where?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09025012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So David&#8217;s young men turned away and came back and told him all this. <b class=verse-num id=v09025013-1>13&nbsp;</b>And David said to his men, &#8220;Every man strap on his sword!&#8221; And every man of them strapped on his sword. David also strapped on his sword. And about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.</p><p id=p09025013_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025014-1>14&nbsp;</b>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them. <b class=verse-num id=v09025015-1>15&nbsp;</b>Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them. <b class=verse-num id=v09025016-1>16&nbsp;</b>They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. <b class=verse-num id=v09025017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him.&#8221;</p><p id=p09025017_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025018-1>18&nbsp;</b>Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys. <b class=verse-num id=v09025019-1>19&nbsp;</b>And she said to her young men, &#8220;Go on before me; behold, I come after you.&#8221; But she did not tell her husband Nabal. <b class=verse-num id=v09025020-1>20&nbsp;</b>And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. <b class=verse-num id=v09025021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Now David had said, &#8220;Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good. <b class=verse-num id=v09025022-1>22&nbsp;</b>God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.&#8221;</p><p id=p09025022_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025023-1>23&nbsp;</b>When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground. <b class=verse-num id=v09025024-1>24&nbsp;</b>She fell at his feet and said, &#8220;On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant. <b class=verse-num id=v09025025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. <b class=verse-num id=v09025026-1>26&nbsp;</b>Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, because the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal. <b class=verse-num id=v09025027-1>27&nbsp;</b>And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord. <b class=verse-num id=v09025028-1>28&nbsp;</b>Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live. <b class=verse-num id=v09025029-1>29&nbsp;</b>If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling. <b class=verse-num id=v09025030-1>30&nbsp;</b>And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel, <b class=verse-num id=v09025031-1>31&nbsp;</b>my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord working salvation himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.&#8221;</p><p id=p09025031_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025032-1>32&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abigail, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! <b class=verse-num id=v09025033-1>33&nbsp;</b>Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from working salvation with my own hand! <b class=verse-num id=v09025034-1>34&nbsp;</b>For as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09025035-1>35&nbsp;</b>Then David received from her hand what she had brought him. And he said to her, &#8220;Go up in peace to your house. See, I have obeyed your voice, and I have granted your petition.&#8221;</p><p id=p09025035_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025036-1>36&nbsp;</b>And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal&#8217;s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light. <b class=verse-num id=v09025037-1>37&nbsp;</b>In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. <b class=verse-num id=v09025038-1>38&nbsp;</b>And about ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.</p><p id=p09025038_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025039-1>39&nbsp;</b>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD who has avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from wrongdoing. The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.&#8221; Then David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife. <b class=verse-num id=v09025040-1>40&nbsp;</b>When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, &#8220;David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09025041-1>41&nbsp;</b>And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, &#8220;Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09025042-1>42&nbsp;</b>And Abigail hurried and rose and mounted a donkey, and her five young women attended her. She followed the messengers of David and became his wife.</p><p id=p09025042_08-1><b class=verse-num id=v09025043-1>43&nbsp;</b>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives. <b class=verse-num id=v09025044-1>44&nbsp;</b>Saul had given Michal his daughter, David&#8217;s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.</p></div>

<h3 id=p09026001_01-1>David Spares Saul Again</h3><p id=p09026001_05-1 class=starts-chapter><b class=chapter-num id=v09026001-1>26:1&nbsp;</b>Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &#8220;Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026002-1>2&nbsp;</b>So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. <b class=verse-num id=v09026003-1>3&nbsp;</b>And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness, <b class=verse-num id=v09026004-1>4&nbsp;</b>David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come. <b class=verse-num id=v09026005-1>5&nbsp;</b>Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.</p><p id=p09026005_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026006-1>6&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab&#8217;s brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, &#8220;Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?&#8221; And Abishai said, &#8220;I will go down with you.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026007-1>7&nbsp;</b>So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him. <b class=verse-num id=v09026008-1>8&nbsp;</b>Then Abishai said to David, &#8220;God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026009-1>9&nbsp;</b>But David said to Abishai, &#8220;Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed and be guiltless?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026010-1>10&nbsp;</b>And David said, &#8220;As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and perish. <b class=verse-num id=v09026011-1>11&nbsp;</b>The LORD forbid that I should put out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed. But take now the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let us go.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026012-1>12&nbsp;</b>So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul&#8217;s head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.</p><p id=p09026012_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026013-1>13&nbsp;</b>Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them. <b class=verse-num id=v09026014-1>14&nbsp;</b>And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, &#8220;Will you not answer, Abner?&#8221; Then Abner answered, &#8220;Who are you who calls to the king?&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026015-1>15&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abner, &#8220;Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord. <b class=verse-num id=v09026016-1>16&nbsp;</b>This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD&#8217;s anointed. And now see where the king&#8217;s spear is and the jar of water that was at his head.&#8221;</p><p id=p09026016_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026017-1>17&nbsp;</b>Saul recognized David&#8217;s voice and said, &#8220;Is this your voice, my son David?&#8221; And David said, &#8220;It is my voice, my lord, O king.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026018-1>18&nbsp;</b>And he said, &#8220;Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is on my hands? <b class=verse-num id=v09026019-1>19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering, but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, &#8216;Go, serve other gods.&#8217; <b class=verse-num id=v09026020-1>20&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.&#8221;</p><p id=p09026020_05-1><b class=verse-num id=v09026021-1>21&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, &#8220;I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and have made a great mistake.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026022-1>22&nbsp;</b>And David answered and said, &#8220;Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and take it. <b class=verse-num id=v09026023-1>23&nbsp;</b>The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed. <b class=verse-num id=v09026024-1>24&nbsp;</b>Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.&#8221; <b class=verse-num id=v09026025-1>25&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to David, &#8220;Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them.&#8221; So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p></div>

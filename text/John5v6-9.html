So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006011-1"><span>11&nbsp;</span></b><span>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006012-1"><span>12&nbsp;</span></b><span>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, </span><span class="woc"><span>“Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.”</span></span><span> </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006013-1"><span>13&nbsp;</span></b><span>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006014-1"><span>14&nbsp;</span></b><span>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, “This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!”</span></p><p id="p43006014_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006015-1"><span>15&nbsp;</span></b><span>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</span></p><h3 id="p43006015_06-1"><span>Jesus Walks on Water</span></h3><p id="p43006015_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006016-1"><span>16&nbsp;</span></b><span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006017-1"><span>17&nbsp;</span></b><span>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006018-1"><span>18&nbsp;</span></b><span>The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006019-1"><span>19&nbsp;</span></b><span>When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006020-1"><span>20&nbsp;</span></b><span>But he said to them, </span><span class="woc"><span>“It is I; do not be afraid.”</span></span><span> </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006021-1"><span>21&nbsp;</span></b><span>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</span></p><h3 id="p43006021_10-1"><span>I Am the Bread of Life</span></h3><p id="p43006021_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006022-1"><span>22&nbsp;</span></b><span>On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006023-1"><span>23&nbsp;</span></b><span>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006024-1"><span>24&nbsp;</span></b><span>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span></p><p id="p43006024_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006025-1"><span>25&nbsp;</span></b><span>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” </span><b class="verse-num" id="v43006026-1"><span>26&nbsp;</span></b><span>Jesus answered them, </span><span class="woc"><span>“Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span></span><span> </span><b class="verse-num" woc="" id="v43006027-1"><span>27&nbsp;</span></b><span class="woc"><span>Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.

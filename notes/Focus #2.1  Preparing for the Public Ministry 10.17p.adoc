.. Concerning the man, John the Baptist
+

[NOTE]
====
Note:  Distinguish this man from others named "John" in the Gospels, especially from John the son of Zebedee, author of the 4th Gospel.
====
+

... John the Baptizer is now to commence his ministry as forerunner of the Messiah; the Gospel records have been silent concerning him since the time of his supernaturally enabled birth.

... John the Baptist was a PROPHET; he conducted himself as a prophet, and he spoke with the boldness and authority of a prophet.  Having heard no prophetic voice for more than 400 years, the nation of Israel responded hungrily to the ministry of this man.


[QUOTE, Shepard 60]

". . . dressed in the rough sack-cloth customarily used by the poor, made of camel's hair and bound about his loins with a leathern girdle.  His food which was the simple diet of the ascetic, learned perhaps through contact with the Essenes or more probably after the example of Elijah, was of locusts, a kind of insect, and wild honey taken from the clefts of the rocks in this rugged wild desert country.  He was a bold and fearless spirit, calling the people to repentance.  He held aloof from the common life and was a dweller in the desert where he had been reared."

+

... John the Baptist is one of the more noble characters in all of Scripture.




.. Concerning the message preached by John the Baptist
    Scripture:

... Remember that John the Baptist was the "forerunner" of the Messiah; he was sent to prepare the hearts of Israel to receive their Messiah, who was soon to appear.

... The message of John the Baptizer may be summarized under 3 points (no recorded poem!):

.... The KINGDOM is at hand; the KING is soon to arrive!
+

[NOTE]
====
Note: Concerning the character of the Kingdom announced by John the Baptist –  See Appendix 2.1A: John the Baptist and the Kingdom of God/Heaven
====
+




.... Therefore, REPENT and prepare yourself to receive this blessed Messiah
+

[NOTE]
====
Note: Concerning the Old Testament significance of "repentance" –cf. Ac 2:38; 3:19; 26:20
====
+


.... Come and be BAPTIZED  as testimony that, in the midst of this wicked and perverse generation you have turned from your sin and accepted the truth concerning the Messiah, and that you are anxious to identify with this promised, soon-coming Christ. (See below.)






.. Concerning the method utilized by John – IMMERSION in water of those who accepted his message

... John had been instructed by God to utilize this technique.   Scripture:

... A difficult question: Did baptism have any prior significance in the minds of the Jews?
          (That is, was there a conceptual antecedent prevalent in the culture which would have informed John’s demand for baptism?)

.... The prevailing idea: Jewish “proselyte baptism”


.... Better: the Jewish rite of “ritual purification” in a MIKVAH
+

[NOTE]
====
It was well understood that John's baptism did not accomplish repentance or acceptance of the individual before God;  that rite was a testimony to the fact that such repentance--and thus, acceptance before God--had already become a reality in the individual's life.
====
+

[QUOTE, Josephus (Ant cviii 5. 2.)]
____
"John . . . commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that washing would be acceptable to him, if they came to it, not in order to the putting away of some sins, but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified before-hand by righteousness."
____


... Concerning the place where John was baptizing
+

[NOTE]
====
See Appendix 2.1B – Where is the place where John the Baptist ministered?  The real issue: how does the place of John’s ministry relate strategically to that ministry?
====
+

... Notice the three distinct stages of the ministry/message of John the Baptist

...  “The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand – about to burst in upon you (in the person of the King)” – i.e., I know by the Scriptures and by divine revelation that He is about to appear; He has yet appeared, but He will do so very soon. Make ready!.  (cf. Mt 3:1-2)


...  “There stands One among you whom you do not know” – i.e., He is here somewhere – I know that because I baptized Him some months ago, but haven’t seen Him since. So you don’t yet know Him because I haven’t yet announced Him to you!
(Jn 1:26)


...  “Behold the Lamb of God! – i.e. There He is! There He is! Don’t follow me – follow Him!  (Jn 1:29, cf. 1:35-42)

.. Summary of John’s ministry – historically and theologically

... Historical notes
.... The Hebrew Scriptures specifically foretold a “forerunner/herald” who would precede and announce the arrival of the promised Messiah/King (Isa 40:1-4; Mal 3:1; 4:5, 6).

.... The birth of John was announced by the angel, Gabriel as the fulfillment of those OT prophecies; it was functionally supernatural; the child was filled with the Spirit (i.e., the OT “theocratic anointing”) from his birth (cf. his recognition of the embryonic Messiah from the womb, Lk 1:39-45); and that birth caused great excitement throughout the reigion of Judea (Lk 1:65, 66).

.... John emerged from the wilderness (i.e., the Jeshimon, the area along the western shore of the Dead Sea) preaching that the King/kingdom was soon to appear and demanding that men acknowledge that the King was soon to appear, and that they submit to baptism by him in the Jordan River as a testimony to their belief in that revelation. However, a person was not fit for that baptism – or for a reception of Yahweh’s Messiah/King – unless he/she had first of all genuinely repented of sin and unbelief.

.... For several months (time - ?), John was the most celebrated person in the world of the Jews, drawing multitudes who confessed their faith in his message, repented and were baptized.

.... John ministered for some months in anticipation of the King (“The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!”); and then, after Jesus had come to be baptized, had insisted that the King/Kingdom had arrived (“There is standing one among you…!” Jn 1:26); and finally, when Jesus appeared (Jn 1:29), had insisted that his disciples follow Jesus instead of following him (John 1:35-37).

.... After Jesus had begun to present Himself as Messiah/King, John and He continued to minister for a time alongside each other in the Jordan Rift (Jn 3:22). When some of John’s disciples registered their concern that Jesus was drawing larger crowds than was John, the herald nobly stepped back from his ministry in order that all the attention might properly be upon God’s Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth.

.... Some months later, John stepped out of retirement long enough to challenge a Roman client-king, Herod Antipas, concerning the wickedness of taking the wife of his brother as his own; as a result John was arrested and ultimately executed by Herod Antipas (Mt 14:1-12).

.... John ben Zecharias was stunningly well loved by the Jewish people, even after that people had rejected the One proclaimed by John as their Messiah.

.... An addendum: Some years later Herod Antipas was defeated in a battle, and many were convinced it was because of his treachery against John the Baptist.
+

[QUOTE, Josephus tells the story (Ant xviii 5.2)]
____
Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only], but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God's displeasure to him.
____
+

.... The retirement of John the Baptist (Jn 3:22-36) is one of the more noble and instructive scenes in the Scriptures.




... Theological Notes
....The baptism of John is not one with Christian baptism.

.... John’s role was that of a herald of the Kingdom which, in the Person of the King, was about to appear.

.... Thus, John’s baptism was not primarily or (in one instance) necessarily a baptism of repentance; it was a baptism of identification with the King/Kingdom of which John was the declared herald.

..... John announced Jesus as the “messenger of the (new) covenant” (Mal 3:1); the Messiah/King/Deliverer whom men had been explicitly and emphatically taught to anticipate ever since the Garden of Eden.

.... John “did no miracle” (Jn 10:41 – lest he be mistaken as the Messiah himself), and yet the Jewish world was turned upside down by him (Mt 3:1-4). This is best understood as a result of two realities: the fever-pitch spirit of Messianic expectation which obtained throughout the Jewish world (and beyond) at that point of human history; and the fact that John’s role had been so emphatically foretold.

.... The conceptual antecedent to John’s baptism – the mikvah/mikvaot which had become so ubiquitous in Israel at that point – emphasizes the fact that what was at stake in John’s ministry was nothing less than coming into contact with God’s Messiah.

... Important: John’s ministry was strategically important to Jesus’ ministry in two particulars:

.... With regard to the all-important question: “How did Jesus get away with proclaiming Himself Messiah-King in that place at that time and for that season?

..... Initially – it was John who was regarded as the leader of this strange religious enthusiasm that erupted suddenly in the region of Judea; thus, in the early months of Jesus’ ministry, as He caught the attention of the multitudes, most of the suspicion of the Jewish leadership was focused on John; Jesus was able to remain “below the radar” for some months, which was strategically advantageous to Him.

..... Throughout His ministry – those who had accepted John’s message provided “cover” for Jesus against the Jewish and Roman authorities who were more and more angry with Jesus. John provided Jesus with a significant population of followers very quickly.  In theological terms, there was a great host who had already become believers when Jesus first appeared publicly, and that host had believed a message which demanded they look for the soon appearance of a man other than John.  Right-minded, careful people had doubtless measured John’s message by the Scriptures and found it entirely acceptable.  So when Jesus did appear, He was able very quickly to build a base of believing support.  As He traveled throughout the land, everywhere He went He was immediately received by followers who had believed John’s testimony, who were breathlessly waiting for the appearance (in their village or region) of the One whom John announced as Messiah, and thus who would have given their lives for the Nazarene though they had never met Him before! In short, again and again Jesus’ enemies want to take Him, but they cannot because they “feared the people” (e.g. Mt 21:46; Mk 11:18). This was very strategic: Roman officers were deputized to keep the peace, and thus a riot over this Nazarene could have spelled disaster for the Roman leadership in a given district.

.... With regard to the legitimacy of Jesus’ messianic claims

[NOTE]

John was sufficient to fulfill one specific prediction concerning the coming of the Christ – that of the forerunner anticipated by Isaiah and Malachi.  Though Jesus’ enemies tried to argue that John did not fulfill that prophecy (Mt 17:10), the angel had announced that he would (Lk 1:16, 17), John had claimed that he did (Jn 1:23), and Jesus affirmed that the Baptist had fulfilled those prophecies in a way that rendered those arguments of His enemies invalid.
====
+

.. An important and difficult question: WHY WAS JESUS BAPTIZED?
... Some deficient responses
.... John and Jesus plotted the event to gain attention for Jesus as He set in motion His ingenious plot of deceit and chicanery to convince the nation of Israel that He was indeed their long-awaited Messiah.
.... Jesus came to be the representative of a sinful race; thus He deigned at this time to symbolize His own purification from sin.
.... Jesus intended His baptism to be a picture of His future death, burial, and resurrection. He knew that it was going to be difficult to get His followers to accept this concept, so He seized upon this opportunity to introduce the idea at the very inception of His public ministry.
.... Jesus' baptism was an act of ceremonial purification unto righteousness, because Jesus was here commencing His ministry as our Great High Priest.
.... The sacramentalist view - "He did not so much get cleansing from baptism as impart cleansing to it. He sanctified the blessed sacrament in the future."
... Two mistakes commonly made in considering this question, "Why was Jesus baptized?"
.... John's baptism is too often considered to be primarily and necessarily a "baptism of repentance."
In fact, it was that only secondarily. It was primarily a baptism of IDENTIFICATION with the announced King and kingdom. However, in the case of sinful men to whom John preached, such identification with the Messianic King and His Kingdom demanded repentance first of all.
.... The attempt is made to find some ulterior motive in Jesus' submission to the baptism of John. According to the New Testament record, there was no such ulterior motive.
+

[QUOTE, Edersheim (Life & Times I:280)]
____
"Again, and most important of all, we must not seek for any ulterior motive in the coming of Jesus to this baptism.  He had no ulterior motive of any kind; it was an act of simple submissive obedience on the part of the Perfect One - and submissive obedience has no motive beyond itself.  It asks no reasons; it cherishes no ulterior purpose."

[NOTE]

An interesting note in this regard: Jesus’ leave-taking moment with His mother at the wedding in Cana – John 4:1-3.
====
+
... The simple reason Jesus went to be baptized by John – He knew it was the right thing to do! (Cf. Mt 3:15, Mt 21:25)
+

[NOTE]
====
Note: In this regard, it is important to realize that the baptism of Jesus by John was not the first act of Jesus’ public life, but the last act of His private life.
====
+

.. The events of Jesus' baptism ... Jesus travelled to the Jordan River specifically to be baptized by John the Baptist.
... Jesus waited until all others had departed (Lk 3:21), and then went to John for baptism.
... John hesitated, but submitted when Jesus instructed him (Mk 3:14,15). Note: The testimony of John the Baptist in John 1:31, 33 is best taken as insistence that the first time Jesus and John the Baptist had ever met face to face was at the Jordan when Jesus was baptized by John.
... Notice that each Person of the triune Godhead was involved in this event.  Q: Why is it important for God to speak aloud in this fashion at this point?

The Father’s Testimony:
“Thou art…!” (Mk 1.11; Lk 3.22)
“This is…!” (Mt 3.17)
Or both?
See Appx 2.1C
====
+

... IMPORTANT: As Jesus emerged from the waters of the Jordan, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him.
+

[NOTE]
====
Note: concerning the anointing of the Spirit in the Old Testament:
====
+

It is my conviction that this is the "theocratic anointing" of Jesus, and by this means Jesus--in His Kenosis--was equipped to set out on the mission He had been given to offer the Kingdom to the nation of Israel.

How does this relate to the issue of the reality of the humanity of Jesus – specifically, to the limitations which are a definitional aspect of His humanity?

. The wilderness experience: fasting, temptation, recuperation with angelic help
(Mt 4:1-11; Mk 1:12,13; Lk 4:1-13)
.. When was Jesus “driven” into the wilderness to endure this season of temptation?  Scripture:
+

[NOTE]
====
Notice that the actual season of deliberate and oppressive temptation of Jesus by Satan happens only after Jesus had “eaten nothing” for 40 days (Lk 4:2; Mt 4:2). What was Jesus’ physical condition after those 40 days? Why is it significant to the narrative?
====
+

.. Re: the PURPOSE of God in this specific and devastating season of temptation endured by His Son, Jesus
... Notice that it was God who initiated this encounter, and not Satan.  Scripture:
+

[NOTE]
====
The point: It is not Satan who traps Christ in the wilderness; rather, it is the Father who deliberately places His Son in open conflict with Satan, in order to establish Jesus' identity and power.
====
+
... What might you suggest was God’s purpose in submitting His Son to this experience?
.. The specific temptations used by Satan against Jesus – and Jesus’ response
... Cf. Gen 3:6 – “…good for food, pleasant to the eyes…desirable to make one wise” (“be like God…”
... 1 Jn 2:16 – “…lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life…”

.... Satan: “Since you are the Son of God, turn stones into bread…”  Jesus: Deuteronomy 8:3
.... From “pinnacle of temple, ”Cast yourself down, angels will bear you up!” (citing Ps 91.11) Jesus: Deuteronomy 6:16
.... From “exceedingly high mountain”: “all these I will give you if you fall down and worship me.”  Jesus: Deuteronomy 6:13
+

[NOTE]
====
Questions:

* The order of the last 2 temptations (MT: ❶ ❷ ❸; Lk: ❶ ❸ ❷)
* Where is that “exceedingly high mountain” from which one might see “all the kingdoms of the world,” and what does that reference suggest concerning the character of this experience?

.. Notice the contrast between the temptation of the first Adam (Gen 3) and the last Adam

|THE TEMPTATION OF ADAM |THE TEMPTATION OF CHRIST

|The devil challenged Adam; it was Satan who took the initiative.
|Christ challenged the devil; the Spirit led Christ into the wilderness, and there the devil was compelled to tempt Him to sin.

|Adam had every possible advantage (paradise, food, companionship, every need met).
|Christ was at the most serious disadvantage, wanting every human comfort and need (hungry, alone).

|The devil emerged victorious. (That is, victory was won for a time by Satan; it was not established as secure or permanent.)
|Christ emerged finally and fully victorious; victory was established as ultimately secure, though not yet entirely won.

|Adam responded to human desire, refused to depend upon the truthfulness of God’s words, fell into sin.
|Christ trusted in the Word of God, stood true to God, resisted sin.

|Adam stood at the head of the race of men; that race fell into sin with him.
|Christ stood as the Head of all those who believe and lifted that number to forgiveness and life.
|===

.. Regarding the ministry of angels to Jesus

... The narrative:
Mt 4:11 “Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.” (Mt 4:11);
Mk 1:13 “And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to Him.”

... What did the angels do on behalf of Jesus?

... How long did these angels minister to Jesus?

.. Important: what is going on with John the Baptist during this time?  *Cf. Jn 1:26 – “there is One standing in your midst…”*

.. An important sidebar consideration: How should we understand the temptation of the sinless God-man, Jesus?

NOTE regarding John 1-4 and the Synoptic Gospels:

- It is at this point that the Synoptics jump to the Galilean Ministry. It is only the fourth Gospel which records the events of the next several months of Jesus' ministry. (Cf. the PROPOSED HARMONY)
- John seems to be consciously relating his account to the Synoptics, especially in the first days of Jesus' ministry after the Temptation. Note carefully the chronological references in John 1:29, 35, 43, 2:1, and then again in 2:12,13. Indeed, John 1:29-2:11 seems to constitute a day-by-day account of the first week of Jesus' public ministry.
====
+

.. The situation: The Sanhedrin, the official body of government among the Jews, sent a delegation to investigate this one called "John the Baptizer."  The responsibility of this committee:
+

[QUOTE, Smith 42]
____
"The Pharisees and Sadducees who had presented themselves as candidates for baptism and been so scornfully rejected, had quitted the scene of their humiliation and carried a report to the Sanhedrin. It is an evidence of the impression which he had made upon them that the rulers did not straightway take vengeance on the audacious prophet. They feared him; they thought it possible that he might be the Messiah or the Messiah's herald. And therefore they resolved to dispatch a deputation to interview him, and ascertain what he claimed to be."
____
+

.. The interview (1:19-27)
... The first question: “Who are you?” (1:19-24)

.... Notice the suggestions the Sanhedrinists offered –

.... A difficult issue: did John the Baptist fulfill the Elijah prophecy of Mal 4:5,6, given his statement in Jn 1:21?
+

[NOTE]
====
See Appendix 2.1D – In what sense (if any) was John the Baptist Elijah?
====
+

.... Notice the explicit claim made by John in response to this question (1:23)

... The second question: "Why do you baptize, then?"  In answer to this question, John tells of one, even now abiding in their midst, in whose authority he has come.

... The aftermath of this interrogation: the Jewish leadership has determined that John the Baptist is a threat who needs to be eliminated (cf. Mt 4:12; Mk 1:14; esp. Mt 17:12).  Soon, those leaders, in league with their Roman overlords and compatriots, would focus their fear and hatred on the One whom John announced as their Messiah (cf. Jn 4:1).

.. Important: note that John the Apostle uses this event as the reference point to his narrative of the first 5 days of Jesus’ public ministry (1:29, 35, 43; 2:1).
+

[NOTE]
====
Thus, this interrogation of John by the Sanhedrinists happened at the very end of Jesus’ wilderness experience, which is to say on the final day of the period we have identified as the preparation for Jesus’ public ministry – thus, one day before the beginning of Jesus’ public ministry.

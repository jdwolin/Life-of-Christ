[NOTE]
====
The ministry of a divinely appointed forerunner, to come in the spirit and power of Elijah, had been clearly prophesied in the OT, and the Jews eagerly awaited the appearance of this herald.

Three primary passages foretelling such a forerunner:

* Isa 40:3-5
* Malachi 3:1
* Malachi 4:5-6

...   Concerning the parents of John (Lk 1:5-7)


....  John was born in the latter days of King Herod (Lk 1:5a)
+

[quote, Unger Bible Dictionary]
____
"Herod was not only an Idumean in race and a Jew in religion, but he was a heathen in practice and a monster in character. During his administration as king he evidenced himself to be exceedingly crafty, jealous, cruel, and revengeful. He exercised his kingly power with the disposition of a very despot."
____

....  John's father, Zacharias, was a priest (Lk 1:5b)
+

[NOTE]
====
Concerning the arrangement of the priests in the days of Jesus:

* The tribe of Levi was granted the priestly office (Dt 33:11). All the sons of Levi were to be workers in the temple, but only one family – the sons of Aaron – were to function in the tabernacle/temple as priests, ministering in the Levitical rituals.
* Concerning the historic lineage of the priestly family:
  * Two of Aaron’s sons were devoured for idolatry (Num 10:1-7); from his 2 surviving sons (Eleazar & Ithamar) had come 24 families; David, denied the privilege of building a temple for King Yahweh, spent the final years of his life arranging the temple services and personnel, including distributing the temple duties among these families.
  * When Israel returned from Babylon, the priests had divided themselves into 24 orders; they alternated in performing the priestly office at Jerusalem, functioning in that capacity approximately twice a year. The balance of the year they lived in locations scattered around the land (reminiscent of the 48 “priestly cities” of the OT theocracy).
====


.... The reproach of John's parents--they were childless (Lk 1:7).
+

[QUOTE, Edersheim I:136]
____
"Such a household as that of Zacharias and Elisabeth would have all that was beautiful in the religion of the time; devotion towards God; a home of affection and purity; reverence towards all that was sacred in things divine and human; ungrudging, self-denying, loving charity to the poor; the tenderest regard for the feelings of others, so as not to raise a blush, nor to wound their hearts; above all, intense faith and hope in the higher and better future of Israel."
____
+

[NOTE]
====
Lk 1:39 – Zacharias & Elizabeth lived in “a city of Judah” in “the hill country” (Lk 1:39). Identified today as Ain Karim, part of modern Jerusalem (c. 4m > Jaffa Gate), with large “Church of the Visitation.”
====


... The angelic announcement to Zacharias (Lk 1:8-17)


.... Zacharias was fulfilling his duties as a priest, pouring the oblation over the altar of incense in the holy place as part of the “morning offering” – thus the “hour of prayer” for the people (Lk 1:10).
+

[NOTE]
====
Note that this was a very honorific duty, available only once in a lifetime; thus, this was a remarkably special day in the life of Zacharias the priest.
====

.... An angel appeared and announced the birth of a son to Zacharias and Elizabeth; because of his incredulity, Zacharias was rebuked and struck dumb until the birth of his child.

.... Notice the substance of the angel's announcement concerning the character and work of the promised son (Lk 1:15-17).
* He was to be a lifetime Nazarite (Lk 1:15).
* The child would be “filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother’s womb” (Lk 1:15).
* He was to turn many Israelites to God (Lk 1:16); indeed, he was to come in fulfillment of the promise made by Malachi concerning the forerunner of Messiah (Lk 1:17).

"To the devout mind, the enrollment under Augustus looms as one of the clearest indications in all history of the providential control of human affairs by an almighty hand.

[QUOTE, Farrar 46]

"But how different is the boy Christ of the New Testament Apocrypha!  He is mischievous, petulant, forward, revengeful.  Some of the marvels told of Him are simply aimless and puerile--as when He carries spilt water in His robe; or pulls the short board to the requisite length; or moulds sparrows of clay, and then claps His hand to make them fly; or throws all the cloths into the dyer's vat, and then draws them out each stained the requisite colour.  But some are, on the contrary, simply distasteful and inconsiderate, as when He vexes and shames and silences those who wish to teach Him; or rebukes Joseph; or turns His playmates into kids; and others are simply cruel and blasphemous, as when He strikes dead with a curse the boys who offend or run against Him until at last there is a storm of popular indignation, and Mary is afraid to let Him leave the house."

"It was probably in AD 8 [sic] that Jesus, twelve years old the previous summer, joined with Joseph and Mary the train of pilgrims travelling southward to Jerusalem to keep that sacred feast which year by year in the month of April was celebrated in commemoration of Israel's deliverance from her bondage in Egypt. . . He had longed for the day when He should go thither and see it all with His won eyes; and now at length His desire is fulfilled. The week of sacred solemnity was like a wondrous dream to the Holy Child.  He would feast His eyes on the impressive pageant and drink in all that He heard."

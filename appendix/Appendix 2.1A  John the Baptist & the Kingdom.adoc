= Appendix 2.1A  John the Baptist & the Kingdom of God/Heaven

I would suggest there are 3 distinguishable ideas as to what John meant specifically by “the kingdom of God/Heaven.”

. In John’s mind, the “kingdom” he announced was precisely the same as the “kingdom” revealed, experienced (Ex 19:5, 6), squandered (Ezek 11:22), and promised to be restored (Dan 2:44; 7:27) in the Hebrew Scriptures (cf Ac 1:6).
+

John understood the “kingdom” to be exactly what had existed for 800 years in the Old Testament and what was prophesied to come when Messiah appears: a literal, physical reign of God over His people Israel and over all the earth.

. In John’s mind, the “kingdom” he announced was in some quintessential sense the “kingdom” of the Hebrew Scriptures, but only in that inner, “spiritual” (mystical, non-literal) sense; the actual manifestation of the “kingdom” he heralded was not what a literal reading of the Old Testament would cause the reader to expect.

[QUOTE, Craig Blomberg 54]

A vast literature discusses the concept of the kingdom in the Gospels. New Testament occurrences of basileia, under the influence of the Hebrew malkuth, most commonly refer to God’s reign or kingly rule. Specifically, “the kingdom” depicts the irruption of God’s power into history in a new and dramatic way with the advent of Messiah Jesus. Much Jewish thought of the day, though highly diverse, equated the arrival of the kingdom with the completion of God’s plans for his people in a physically visible, materially prosperous, and powerful geopolitical entity. The kingdom continues to be so viewed by some who deny its presence with Jesus’ first advent. Such an approach often leads to the notion that because most of the Jews rejected Jesus’ call to repentance he withdrew his offer of the kingdom and postponed its arrival until his second coming. Others delete all future aspects, “de-apocalypticizing” the kingdom and turning it into a form of existence in human history which illustrates new possibilities of relationships among people.

A large consensus and a vast array of scriptural data support a two-pronged focus in which the kingdom is both present and future (both in Jesus’ day and our own)—contrast, e.g., Matt 12:28; Luke 7:22–23; 17:20–21 with Matt 6:10; Luke 13:28–29; Mark 9:47. The kingdom is not currently a geographical entity, but it manifests itself in space and time in the community of those who accept the message John and Jesus proclaimed and who begin to work out God’s purposes on earth—personally, socially, and institutionally. Thus to declare that the kingdom is at hand “means that the decisive establishment or manifestation of the divine sovereignty has drawn so near to men that they are now confronted with the possibility and the ineluctable necessity of repentance and conversion.

[QUOTE, Craig Blomberg 55]

The kingdom sums up God’s plan to create a new human life by making possible a new kind of community among people, families, and groups. [It combines] the possibility of a personal relationship to Jesus with man’s responsibility to manage wisely the whole of nature; the expectation that real change is possible here and now; a realistic assessment of the strength of opposition to God’s intentions; the creation of new human relationships and the eventual liberation by God of the whole of nature from corruption.

. John understood “kingdom” as it was revealed in the Old Testament, but he was later disappointed when he realized Jesus meant something different.
+

What was so compelling about John’s preaching that he gathered disciples who continued to following him long after his death, perhaps even rejecting the preaching of the disciples of Jesus?

.. First, John’s preaching was drawn from the Hebrew Bible and declared that the Messianic age was about to begin with a fiery judgment. This is one of the most common messianic expectations in the Second Temple Period and it was popular because many who were looking forward to a Messiah expected him to deal with the nations oppressing God’s people.

.. Second, there may have been some dissatisfaction with Jesus’ version of the Kingdom of God. The idea that the Messiah would become the suffering servant and die on behalf of others was not a common view. In fact, claiming that the Messiah would die to take the curse of the Law on himself is virtually unique to Christian preaching. For the disciples of John, then, it is at least possible that the rejected Jesus and his disciples because these new “Christians” misunderstood the Messiah.

Is there a contrast between John’s preaching and Jesus with respect to the Kingdom?  Is it possible that John was looking for something different than what Jesus ultimately offered as a Kingdom?
